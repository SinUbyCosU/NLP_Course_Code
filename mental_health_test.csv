i don't understand whats wrong with me. i don't know why i freak out sometimes. like right now i'm just laying in bed nothing is happening but i can't keep the tears running from down my face. it's stupid. i'm honestly fine nothing is wrong. why on earth am i like this?
"usually when i have anxiety just chatting with someone or just having someone to physically be there for me is all i need to start feeling better. my anxiety is always worst at night, and it’s such a shitty feeling knowing that my girlfriend is literally sharing the bed with me but i still feel like i’m completely alone. i want to just reach over and wake her up but i feel like i’d just be being a nuisance. so what do you guys do when you can’t sleep because of anxiety but can’t talk to anyone because they’re all asleep? i usually just end up suffering in silence until the sun comes up and my girlfriend wakes up, then i feel comfortable and tired enough to go to sleep. ig i’m just weird, i can’t sleep unless i’m the first one to fall asleep."
"well, i've had anxiety and panic syndrome for a few years. it all started in my school back in 2014, my heart went insane for no reason, got so bad that i had to ask my dad to pick me up, we went to the hospital and my blood pressure was very high, years passed and now, 2016, the symptons got way worse, so bad that i dropped out. so, what's your story?"
"for the most minimal of things, like standing in someone's way for just a moment. does anyone else notice this character trait? it's not out of habit, it's a subconscious quirk. i think, deep down, i legitimately believe i'm inconveniencing people when i say it."
"i stay away from family and live with my roommate who literally games all the uselessin time! it's like he is happy he doesn't have to go to college anymore this is a blessing for him. he has no other interests i'm stuck in my head all day! this pandemic really makes it worse for those who need distractions to escape from all the overthinking and anxiety! trying to develop new hobbies such as reading and stuff, watching shows and movies also gets boring after a while"
"i'm very ecstatic, i got a job that literally fits around my anxiety! a family member of mine talked to anotger friend wjo works at an auto parts shop and she said she completely understands what i'm going through and the company will take me on! all i do is deliver parts and sweep that's it full time 8 to 5! not only that but they're accommodating for my group therapy!"
"i've been feeling anxious today, but it's always a good reminder for everyone. the fear and anxious feelings and symptoms won't last forever. you are loved and cared for, and it's going to be okay. &lt;3"
"i'm not sure where to post this, i just need to talk about it. two days ago my mother was told she had 3 weeks left to live. she couldn't move or talk and her breathing was fast. two weeks before that she was in remission for breast cancer and fine then fast forward to now and the problem was her liver, they had to keep draining fluid.. last night she said one thing to me, it was what seemed like seconds of clarity, that she loved me and called me by my name. i told her goodnight and that i loved her, knowing she wouldn't make it i had to call everybody and inform them things took a turn for the worst. 4am this morning she passed away and i'm completely torn up. waves of depression and a million other emotions keep hitting me every ten minutes. i don't want this depression to eat me alive. i'm now the sole provider for my little sister and we have to be positive... it's heart breaking. i want to sleep forever and cry all day. i'm depressed and miss my mom. edit- thank you to everyone who commented such nice things and messages of support. it really helped to read through some of them and realize i'm not alone and she is without pain and suffering now. to have so many people care about someone they never met is amazing and i have no words."
"i always feel so consumed by self hatred and the fact that i can be such a piece of shit. i am scared i might actually do it some day. that i might actually take myself out. i have recently been thinking about breaking my own finger, punching myself, trying to break an arm and even jumping from my room on the 10th floor of the building. i have thought so much about what i could do to myself to seemingly punish myself for merely existing. i'm scared and i cant handle the stress anymore and i want something bad to happen. that's all that's ever on my mind anymore, is i wish something would come and hurt me in some way."
"- keeping the appointment with the dentist, because tooth pain sucks, even though all you really want to do is stay in bed - scheduling an appointment for the root canal you need, even though the mere thought of the procedure has you quaking in your boots - paying the bill that's ten days late for no reason other than you couldn't bring yourself to task on the day it was due - taking the car to the shop because the check engine light has been on for weeks and the inspection is due at the end of the month - doing all of the above and still not feeling proud of yourself or accomplished because there are a hundred other small things you're avoiding or flat out ignoring just to keep from feeling like your life is spiraling down the drain. who the hell let me adult."
"i didn't wake up yesterday until 6pm. i laid in bed until 9, woke up and bought a case of beer and 2 packs of cigarettes and started binge drinking. i took a shower for the first time in days. i wanted to be clean and drunk for what i planned to do. today is my 25th birthday. i didn't want to live this day. i planned to cut my arms up and bleed to death in the shower, but i wanted to play a few last rounds of rocket league to calm my nerves. then i got a message from a random player i was in a few matches with: ""wanna play in a party? playing with randoms is getting on my nerves."" i'd never played in a party with a friend, let alone a stranger, but i thought why not? we got to playing and he asked if i had a headset, which i do. we started talking and the matches went by as the conversation flowed. we had so much in common that it was almost freaky. as of writing this, it's 6am. i had no intention of being alive right now, but we had so much fun playing together that i completely forgot about my plans to kill myself. so, devin, thank you for saving my life. thank you for showing me a kindness i haven't felt in months. thank you for being so open and honest with me. thank you for showing me a reason to live. thank you. and thank you so much to all of you sweet, caring people. your words of kindness have continously lifted my spirits throughout the day today. i've told my family everything and will be seeking help in the form of therapy and a possible medication adjustment, if necessary. if you're out there reading this and you can't see the way back up, cling to me and we'll climb up together. again, thank you all so much for taking the time out of your day to wish me well and feel free to pm me anytime or to add me on psn: coonroast55 (it has to do with my last name and the fact that me and my friends used to put -roast on the end of everyone's last name for no reason whatsoever). &lt;3"
"you guys ever get outside, get that extreme spark of motivation like, “useless yeah! things are looking up for me now. this world can kiss my ass because i’m gonna make it out of here!” then, what feels like seconds later, something comes and rains shit on you. it’s like nothing ever lasts. when the useless are people like us ever gonna get a break? were shoveling shit all day, everyday and nobody uselessing cares. but the instant we say we’re giving up, everyone’s like “oh no! you have so much to live for! think about x,y, and z! you can’t give up! things are gonna get better!” yeah, shove it up your ass. you’re just trying to make sure your conscience is clean when i’m dead and gone. you think you care, but you’re really just being cautious for yourself and trying to save your own soul while acting to save another. good luck with that. i’m tired of being told to get help. with what uselessing money? all just to talk to some damn superficial person who is literally being paid to be a friend to me because i’m so uselessing shit at doing it without paying? what the hell is the point of trying? i’m stuck here, just like i’ll always be. just give me the freedom to take my leave. i’ll be happy then, but i’ll be decaying in the ground by then. ironic, huh? i wish things were different."
"no control, no ambition, no motivation. just nothing. i really wish i could muster up effort to start anything. go to the doctor, talk to somebody, start a hobby, start learning something, but instead i do nothing and feel uselessing powerless. if i do do something, i quit after one or two days."
"i don't know if it's because i feel they won't care, like i'm being annoying, or if i realize i simply don't want to share. i just know i do it."
"you’re depressed! you’re okay, it’ll take time, but you’re okay! what the hell is taking so long, life blows, you’re depressed again! you woke up and got dressed today, it’s looking up from here? sike, you uselessing idiot, did you truly believe your depression was done with you? you’re dumber than you lead yourself to believe! okay, we’re okay, we’re gonna make it. i just gotta stay strong. oop, you uselessed up once today, i’m dragging your ass back into the dark. over and over and over! is there really only one way out? i don’t know if i wanna die, i got a brother who may need me one day. i’m tired. so tired, man."
"did my title catch your attention enough? good. because i have no idea what to write here. only time i need to use a subreddit like this is when i'm really freaked out, and when i'm upset like this i can't think straight and write some awesome cool post for you, sorry. edit: wow! i had no idea this would blow up like it did. the reason why i made a title that demanded such attention was because i saw all these other posts flying by with 1 or 0 comments on them. thank you for all the responses. i'm going to be writing an update post which will be titled something along the lines of [""my fate rests in this title: creative.. i know.. thank you and have a good day! edit 2: added link"
"i’ve been having the worst time of my life these past months and in return, i’ve been late on assignments. my parents know that i’ve been dealing with really bad depression and anxiety lately and i’ve told them the reason why my assignments are overdue. it’s because i’m too mentally drained and unmotivated to do it. i️ can’t come up with anything to write because i’m too focused on how bad everything is. they never ask me how i’m doing, they ask me if i️ve gotten any homework done yet. and i️ just can’t take it anymore."
"this field needs higher barriers of entry and more active policing among its members. people always say ""see a therapist!"" but man, there are a lot of uselessed up and dangerous therapists out there. therapists who are more than willing to use your depression against you and for their favor. hoo boy i've met some messed up therapists. i decided to try and find one again, and they're either booked or creeps. when people say ""see a therapist!"" they should put an asterisk next to it that says ""warning: therapists are often dangerously unethical and creepy. be careful."" of course what ""see a therapist!"" really means is ""stop bothering me with your problems, i'm trying to watch netflix in my pajamas."" such is life, eh? /rant"
"am i the only one? am i being rude? there’s this coworker of mine who’s always so cheerful and laughs super loud and high pitch like some disney character. i try to think positive and understand that she’s actually a sweet person, but she irritates me. aaaand truthfully... i used to be bubbly and a people person. then shit happened. and now i just want to be left alone in silence. with my cat."
"my depression is clinical, but i know that depending on my situation, it affects it heavily, i know that my depression would still be there even if i were to just take my savings and go off somewhere, but the thought of ""starting over"" from the ground up is very attractive. i would still be depressed, but possibly happier. somewhere where i can put on a persona and be someone else. get out of my current environment of a job i hate, and an undesirable living situation with my mother. i don't like the area or state i live in either. i wish it were just that easy to pack my bags and leave. well it is, but i'm not savvy or street smart enough to figure out what to do once i was in a new place. i still daydream about it a lot though. starting over sounds nice."
"i've been depressed since i was a child. diagnosed at 7 years, and unsuccessfully treated for the next 6. i lie when my mother asks if i'm ok. i don't cut because people would ask questions. and i can't put those closest to me through the confusion and trauma of a seemingly inexplicable suicide. for all they know, i'm happy. but i'm not. and i haven't been for nearly my entire life. i turn 31 next week. i've put up with my depression and gritted my teeth hoping time would resolve it for me. or maybe i'd find someone that could see the impossibly subtle signals i've woven into my personality. but i guess i've gotten too good at lying. just never good enough to actually fool myself. i feel stuck. forced to live a long con. my life doesn't matter enough to be anyone else's problem, and for most of the same reason, i don't even have the luxury of ending it. it's just not an option. i've made the mistake of allowing the people i care about to love the facade i've constructed, and now i have to drag it along with me. i suppose i was being selfish, but i thought it might help being loved. that i could beat depression by overwhelming it with affirmation. but all i've really done is given my life value through others. it no longer belongs to me, and it wouldn't be fair to take it from them. and this is my hell; personally crafted and painfully maintained. my depression has achieved complete saturation, and has found a way to perpetuate itself through guilt. this isn't a cry for help, or an admission of weakness. i just want someone to know. i am suffering, and i need this one selfish moment to allow myself to feel like it's all real. as if it means something. because once i log off, it'll just be me again."
"i've been in this shit for 3 years, and i have literally zero friends. the only people i speak to are my parents, and they annoy the useless out of me. my grades are so poor i almost got dismissed from the university. everyone around me is getting laid and having the time of their lives. they're all making connections to their lucrative new jobs and falling in love. i have absolutely none of that. i'm not even interested in my uselessing major, and i'm not talented enough to survive if i drop out. all of these trends like netflix &amp; chill and snapchat and pokemon go, i haven't experienced any of them, because i have no one to hang out with. it's just been 3 years of pure loneliness."
"i'm going through some rough times, sure, but i definitely don't have it the worst. my family loves me and i've got one or two good friends but i just can't help but feel like something's missing. always. and it doesn't help that i'm a dude either. if you're a guy, you're expected to be able to ward off any sadness and just get on like normal but it's not that easy. i know something's wrong with me but i feel like everyone thinks i'm too good to be depressed and i can't let my emotions out. damn this is hard."
"i wish i could just cease to exist. not to die, but to never even exist. never been born. everyday it gets harder and harder to get up and go about my day. i feel like a useless up and a disappointment to my family. no matter how hard i try and get my shit together something pops up and it gets worse. the stress, the anxiety, the thoughts. they eat away at me and the longer it goes on the more i want to disappear. i don’t even know why i’m posting this here. i just needed to write it out somewhere. god even on here i want to say sorry to you guys. everything i always end up saying to people. i’m sorry for being a bother. i’m sorry for you having to waste your time pretending to care about me."
"i am so uselessing tired of seeing some pretty faced halfwit trying to console me on my life acting like they understand but clearly have no uselessing grasp on what depression is like. they give these extremely trivial and laughably meaningless reasons not to end it all and all it does is make it worse. listing music and videos as """""""" reasons"""""""" not to kill ourselves doesn't actually uselessing help anyone. /rant"
"it is such a cruel catch-22, how from within this condition of intense isolation, dread, and dysfunction, the nicest thing would be to have people around to talk to and be close to -- yet being afflicted by those things makes you an unattractive person to be around, and incapable of seeking out and making friends."
"i feel like i almost get some weird sense of satisfaction when i'm in a cycle of self loathing. i don't feel happy during it, but there's something addicting about having that nasty inner critic voice just shit on me and my self worth. it may be a type of cathartic release i'm feeling. whenever i try to reason with these thoughts and assert my worth, i feel uncomfortable. maybe it's because i feel undeserving and that i'm lying to myself to feel better. it's easier to mope and let the spiral of negative thoughts continue, and any resistance to it feels straining and requires a lot of mental effort. tl;dr anyone else feel a sense of catharsis when you have a spiral of negative thoughts of yourself? any tips for getting out of that cycle of thoughts?"
"it's really silly, but i need to walk one egg a day, do one raid and get 10'000xp. that's the only freaking thing i can get done in a day. it has no value, but at least it's something."
"title. 25m for reference, here to vent and commiserate okay so years upon years of soul-searching and bearing with the onslaught of pain and bullshit of life and maybe a few hundred downward dogs and hypocritical spiritual begging and i have finally gotten to the point where 51% of the time suicide is not in my immediate consciousness. great... **now what?** i still don't want to live, or at least have no motivation to, like, *live.* i save every penny i make. i live with my parents and have absolutely no incentive to move out. if i moved out i would just sleep and read and sit in a chair in an otherwise empty apartment with a recurring rent bill higher than my paycheck instead of in a house with my parents and pets occasionally around. i don't like to travel, i don't like to go places, i am passionate about exactly nothing, the opportunity cost of anything material i could buy to bring into my life is too high, i can't go back to school because my degree is stupid and, well, i just don't care. i don't care. i'm empty. i just exist. i exist to exist. every single human in my vicinity criticizes my inaction. people don't understand that just working, doing yoga, reading and sleeping are the only things i can even force myself to do and bear with the pains associated with them. if there's a flame inside people that burns and motivates and gives people the desire to acquire things and go experience things and want to make their lives into something different, or just well, makes people uselessing ***do*** anything, well, i don't have it. mine's burnt out. i am burnt out. thanks for reading my lame-ass post, please share your experiences, and maybe if you're a zen master share how you've re-lit your internal flame &amp;#x200b;"
"i used to think i was content with being depressed, i've felt it for so long that i just decided to embrace it and give up socialising or reaching out. then when you meet someone really nice briefly you are reminded on what you're missing out on in life and just feel like shit for ages afterwards, i'm sick of feeling that. i feel like i'll always be nomadic with relationships and friendships and just endlessly drift through life alone. it's weird, some days i can give advise, today though i don't really feel too good. i know i just have to push on with life but it doesn't half get lonely living my life."
"no i'm not staying in bed until 3pm because i think it's cool, funny or that i'm lazy. it's because i can't bring myself to get up. i'm not wasting my life away on purpose or by choice. this isn't how i want things to be."
"my depression has the opposite effect on me, it makes me want to eat a lot every time i get sad. i've been obese my whole life and i fear i'm starting to get health problems because of that. i've tried to lose weight many times before but it's really hard to eat less and exercise when you don't have any energy or motivation at all... i wish i didn't want to eat. is it weird? edit: forgot a word. also, i know that not eating is as bad as over-eating, it's just that i am obese and if i could lose weight without trying it would be one thing less to worry about i guess"
"you can cuss me out with insults, you can treat me like a subhuman, you can spit in my face, whatever. but please, please don't ignore me. i want my existence to be acknowledged. i want to be sure that i'm not just an invisible pair of eyes roaming around, witnessing everything happening without anybody noticing i'm there, like i'm an outsider looking in. please don't make me feel any more isolated than i already do, like i have no friends who genuinely care about me. i know i suck, and i know i useless everything up frequently, and you're welcome to hurl expletives at me for it. i deserve it. but whatever you do, i'm begging you, *please* don't act like i'm not there at all."
"have you ever hated everything so bad that you just wanted to be nothing...like literally nothing, just blank. \- it's like the fear many people have of there being nothing but blank when they die, but for that nothigness to be your escape?"
"when you have depression or anxiety aging feels 10 times worse. i’m 21 and i feel incredibly old already. i suppose the worst part is that when you are a kid in highschool people always say that life “gets better” and of course the media really hypes up your early 20s as the best time in your life. i am very socially isolated with no friends. all i do is attend community college and feel like a failure... yet this is the so called “prime of my life?!” i find it depressing that my physical peak is coming and going so quick. i feel like i have no control over time - i constantly worry about how fast it’s passing and i’m not afraid to make life changes due to anxiety. i know , life doesn’t end when you turn 30. but for someone like me who probably never will get married or have kids aging seems hopeless. my body will decompose all while i get forgotten about by the world. hell, being lonely at 21 sucks enough i can’t imagine being lonely and isolated at 40+ ."
"i wish i could hibernate. i don't want to die, i just want to go to bed for a couple months and come back to the world when i feel ready."
"ever since i was little, i was always that odd person that would try to put herself into situations in order to socialize and have a group of ""friends"". i was always left out because of this and they actively tried to avoid me. i just gave up trying to make friends for a long time until i hit high school. i was se\*\*\*lly a\*\*aulted when i was 14 and i was scared to do anything or be alone, so i broke out of my anti-social shell and made friends. i was friends with this small group until we graduated high school. i'm a junior in college and i'm in this predicament again. i tried to make friends in college but it was rocky and i just felt like an outcast. they wouldn't invite me to hang out or would try to make excuses as to why i shouldn't come. i let all of these people walk all over me so i wouldn't have to be alone. ever since the pandemic, i have been feeling down and struggling. i don't have any friends to communicate with, to talk about our days, or to just video chat with so i'm not alone. sometimes, i just feel like i'm a failure to my parents because i'm not as outgoing or social as my brother is or my cousin is. i always say, ""at least i'm not out doing drugs"" just to make the situation seem less sad. it doesn't work and i just feel sad and alone. how do you make friends that stick because i'm tired of just sitting in the house, looking at peoples' stories, and feeling envious that i don't have a group of friends to do stupid shit with."
"i am talking about people that have it all. they are pretty, loved, successful, rich, happy, have a lot of friends and they accomplish everything they think of. life seems like a walk through a rose garden to them. they enjoy life and want to live forever. on the other side there are people like me or you. trying to get through everyday and find motivation to keep up the fight and don't give up. hoping for a miracle or some kind of change. you find yourself alone every night hoping that tommorw will be different but it isn't. days, months, years pass by and nothing has changed. you're losing the will to keep fighting and start questioning yourself, life, faith or god if there really isn't even a small piece of happiness for you in this world when there's plenty of happiness for others. you never asked too much from life but even the little you have asked for was not given to you. another day passes by and you try to keep up the fight."
"send me your energy pls. i don’t really care what happens but i’m proud to have done this and gotten to know someone like her. first time really putting myself out there since the start of my depressive episodes. i haven’t known her for long but since i’ve met her i have constant butterflies and i feel sick almost. i knew i didn’t really have a choice other than to try lol. if for no other reason to get some closure. anyway, wish me luck guys. hopefully this works out for the best. edit: welp. i sent the text at 11 last night and still no reply. i think she would have read it to because she asked me what i had in mind when i said i wanted to hang out tomorrow night. it’s 7:30 am now and nada. we still had plans to study today and hopefully that doesn’t fall through. i’m okay with this though because i did what i felt i needed to do, hopefully we can still hang out like we’ve been doing. thanks for the good vibes guys it’s a really nice change of pace for the usual stuff on this sub and thanks for the good energy :-) edit 2: hey friends she just responded like 15 hours later. she said it sounds fun and she still wanted to study later. she said she has an exam she needs to study for so she may not be able to go but all and all at least i didn’t get rejected! i’m ok with this result wish me luck guys. edit 3: i’m at the show alone and ok with it. thanks for the energy and all."
"the shame and stigma that comes with being mentally ill can be very difficult to cope with, as most people can't see a crushed self like they see a broken leg. i have been going through the yet most difficult time, and what aches my heart is when i lose a friend or i feel the sucpesion of being lazy or acting up only to get attention. lately i truly wished that my illness becomes physical, even if i die in a few weeks, but then i'll have friends and family knowing that i really suffer and comforting me until saying the last goodbye. i apologize for anyone suffering from cancer or have a dear one suffering from it, having lost my father to it i know it is not to be talked about lightly. but i really hate feeling hated and alienated because what i feel is taking life out of me every day, to many looks just like a failure at doing things right, or even if understood it still makes people undesirable and socially marginalized. so, is my thought common? or have i missed out on something that when i come to realize will make the thought sound preposterous?"
"i hate it when my ""friends"" say this. i don't know if they don't care or don't know how to help or if they genuinely believe this. i've also gotten comments like ""stop being sad"" or (for my anxiety) ""stop worrying."" i don't know if people don't take me seriously or just don't want to. i ask for help, and no one answers (anymore, i pushed away the one person that did care about me and it kills me). i've just retracted into my own shell. no one understands the pain i feel (as edgy and cliche as that sounds) and i don't think anyone will even bother to try ever again. i don't fit anywhere. i don't belong here. i feel like at this point i'm just delaying the inevitable and that, if i did go, no one would miss me. no one would even uselessing notice..."
"depression (and then later anxiety) really robbed me of my teen years and early 20s. in work people were talking about their teenage memories, going out and drinking with their friends, teenage romances, going on holidays with their families. i never had that. i was isolated and spent all my time in my room on my computer. i had online friends i met in forums and we played world of warcraft most nights. some of my most memorable nights were spent in my bedroom eating pizza and playing wow until 5 and birds were chirping outside. i really do feel like i'm an outsider looking in at all the normal people sometime."
"i was putting dishes in the sink this morning so i could wash them before going to work. my phone goes off in my pocket. it's my mom. my heart drops. my grandma's health has been declining for the last year and we've had a few scares where she's close to death. so, naturally i think that my grandma had passed. no, it was the sheriff. my heart drops even farther now. oh god, who is it? he says eric lastname had passed away this morning. he went for a walk and someone found him dead. at this time, i'm just in shock thinking this is some uselessed up dream. eric has been my step father for the last 21 years. we butted heads from the start, but he kept me straight and pushed me to do better. i would hate to see where i would be if it weren't for eric being in my life. i could only imagine that i would be living on the streets, or dead. eric and i have recently gotten closer. i started calling him dad, joking with him and venting about bullshit in life. he was much more of a dad than my father ever was. he bent over backwards to help me, whether it be some money we need to get a car fixed, or just being there for me. i didn't tell my kids today because we had about 5 minutes before the bus came. they saw me crying, but didn't see me freaking out, so probably think it's just another episode that daddy has sometimes. i get calmed down a bit and take them to the bus stop. waiting at the bus stop, my two oldest sons start talking about going to grandma and grandpa's house this weekend. they're so excited about fishing and putting up string traps for deer (it's super flimsy yarn that they put in the branches. doesn't hurt deer at all). i had to go home after that. i couldn't let them see me losing it again. on the walk home, i called my mom's cell. the sheriff answers and hands the phone to my mom. you could tell she was still in shock that the love of her life is dead and gone forever. i told her that i would be coming down as soon as i could. i live about an hour away, so it's no big deal getting there. i'm about to head out in a few minutes to go see her. this is the worst thing that could happen now. eric was taking care of finances for my grandma since she's in hospice and their own finances. so now she'll have to take care of her house and land, plus my grandma's land. we don't expect grammy to live for another 6 months or so. so, that gives us a bit of time to think, but i know my mom is going to be devastated for quite some time. i'm ok at the moment, but i know i'm going to be pretty uselessed up about this for a long time. i love that man as a father. he was someone i could look up to. someone who would give you the shirt off of his back, or meet me half way between cities to give me money we desperately needed. i miss that man. i may need to call my doctor to get my antidepressants upped. i don't deal with death well at all."
"after having to take a medical leave from a good college because of my depression and social anxiety, what i did today made me extremely happy. i hope i keep doing better. edit: thank you for all the support! i think this goes to show that any step you take to better yourself, no matter how small, is significant. i love this community."
"now that i've struggles with this bullshit for 7 years, i've come to the realisation that literally no one cares no one is genuinely there for you. everyone will claim to be there for you and beg you to open up to them because they want to be the hero who 'saves' you from your mental illness, but they're thinking of a glamourised, coming of age mental illness no one wants to deal with the reality - not getting out of bed for 3 days straight and then finally getting up and not showering or brushing your teeth because you don't have the energy to. deleting your social medias and ignoring texts for days on end because you just can't quite bring yourself to talk to people. going through days of mania followed by weeks of lowness and having people expect you to be okay because of those few days of mania everyone wants to be there for you until you actually show symptoms"
"i snapped and told myself i wouldn't take the loneliness for another day. i felt like i tried and tried, and nothing worked. so i found something to hang myself with, but chickened out at the very last minute. now i'm here and feel the hurt all over again."
"sounds weird, right? but lately i've been so depressed that i've stopped caring about everything, to the point where it's actually making me happy. can't pay bills on time? oh well, who gives a damn! lonely on new year's eve, whatever, i really don't like people anyway. my social anxiety is going away too. because i no longer care about what people think of me. i've hit rock bottom, and it feels good! lol, i think i've officially lost it! :)"
"i was diagnosed with major depression and generalized anxiety when i was hospitalized over a year ago. since then i've been put on tons of medication. i hate the meds, i don't feel sad or anxious as much anymore, but now i just feel emotionless and apathetic. i don't even feel like myself anymore and i hate it, i feel like i've had my emotions and motivation taken from me. now all i wanna do is lay in bed."
"i keep thinking about my future and the only thing that seems plausible is my suicide. i'm socially awkward, stupid, and have high levels of anxiety. i feel incompatible with this world."
"it's terrible feeling. i want to cry, just let it out, but i can't. it feels like my soul is crying, but i just physically can't get it out. it's like i'm stuck with this pain forever and am not allowed to at least alleviate it in a way. i... just can't explain it... i just hope someone understands..."
"i quit my job today. it was uselessing terrible. not quitting, but being there. from september, i've had the worst time working there and trying my best for an abusive relationship. it took every fiber of my being to go through with it, but i feel like i've shed a ten ton husk. long time lurker, but i had to make an account to post this."
"after months of being stuck in a loop of staying indoors and not stepping outside my comfort zone, i decided that i needed to challenge myself and do something that i haven’t done before. usually i go to the gym with my boyfriend, but even then, it has to be on a day when it is quiet, otherwise i feel overwhelmed. i had gotten kinda out of shape as i haven’t been to the gym now for around 3 months. honestly, i’ve been starting to get super negative thoughts about the way i look so i really wanted to change that before it gets worse. for me, working out is one of the few things that i actually enjoy doing! a bonus is that it helps me sleep like a rock. i kept telling myself that the worst that could happen would be if i get something wrong, and people stare at me- but so what? no one really cares about what others do in the gym. with this in mind, i managed a great workout session and i plan to keep it up. i feel amazing! taking small steps and even having the intention of doing something new is a good step to take. i hope you guys work towards doing something new today. ☺️"
"i’m at a resort with my friends and their parents (i’m 17). so it’s just us and my friends and the bar crowd at this disco area in the resort and my friend pushes me to sing karaoke with him in front of an audience. it was uselessing awful my voice was already raspy , yet i was somehow expected to carry the song. everyone was laughing at us as. we heard from our friends in the crowd how much everyone was roasting us and it was terrible. it was uselessing terrible and i feel terrible. my friends don’t think it’s that big of a deal and told me “not to worry it’s whatever”. they even want to try again tomorrow. i feel like i’m crazy but no one is acknowledging just how embarrassing it was for me and how truly crippling social anxiety is when you’re in front of a large audience while everyone is laughing at your failure. i honestly want to kill my friends or myself at this point. not actually but i’m just super pissed and disappointed and embarrassed. no one takes this serious but me and it’s annoying because everyone just brushes it off and actually shares it to others. it’s just even worse when my friend choked throughout the whole song and i basically had to do 80 percent of a song i barely knew , with my already raspy voice and my anxiety in general. it was just disaster. pure disaster. i just want to disappear honestly. not even die or yell or anything. just disappear. pretend i don’t exist. turn into a wall and never come out."
"i'm always anxious, especially when i go out in the mornings and when i have to interact with people. going to breakfast this morning in a diner was a huge success for me. i brought a book, i had pancakes, sausage, coffee, and hash browns, and i was very anxious... but i loved it. i'm glad i did it. it was small step but a big victory for me."
"posting this is extremely nerve-wracking, but hey, i'm doing it! oh. my. god. i actually did it you guys! 6 months ago my psychologist convinced me to take an online english class... i was so reluctant and was about to quit more than a handful of times, but despite crying my eyes out my psychologist wouldn't let me quit. she knew i could do it, and i'm so thankful she didn't enable me when i wanted to run the other way. i owe this woman everything. it's been 7+ years since i finished school, and this is the only thing i have accomplished since then. it was without a doubt hard and it felt impossible at times, but i'm so proud of myself now - something that rarely happens."
"it started off okay, i was answering questions, trying to get to know the 2 interviewers. then the ceo of the company asked a question, i began to answer, and he kept interrupting me when i began to talk. this totally derailed my train of thought, stressed me out to the max, and i started to cry. i did regain composure and finish the interview but i just want to crawl into a hole and die. the thought of going to another interview, even at another company, and i start crying all over again. help."
"i love to grow flowers, it's pretty much my only hobby and the main way that i de-stress. i have flower beds all around my house and i view my plants as my ""babies."" but last year my emotional support cat passed away at 12 years old and i feel like my soul went with him, it was the worst pain i've ever experienced. in my grief i completely neglected my garden for the whole year. that cat was like furry xanax to me, and now that he's gone my anxiety has been at it's worst. but today i said ""no more hiding"" and i went back outside and weeded the beds, planted some more dahlias and lilies, mulched, and trimmed my roses. i even met the new neighbor without getting nervous and going back inside. now my beloved garden has its life back, and i feel a little bit better. now that i have new things popping up from the ground i have no excuse to ignore them. i hope i can muster up the strength to keep going. for today, i'm proud of myself."
"let me practice what i preach if i may... this morning, and most mornings, i fought off an incredibly severe bout of anxiety as soon as i opened my eyes. the rush of adrenaline and angst was nearly overwhelming. however, i took deep breaths, caught myself, told myself everything is fine, thought of 5 things i was grateful for and one thing i was super excited about and looked forward to in the future. soon after that my anxiety was gone and my mind was on to other things. i didn't give those dreadful thoughts any attention and i didn't entertain them. i simply let them pass and subtly replaced them with positive thoughts. i hope this can help at least one person to have a better day, or even a better moment to see that there's always a light. more positive posts would help all of us don't ya think?"
"i’ve had the worst week of my life. pretty much lost the will to live. my anxiety has been at a all time high since i calmed it down a while ago. as seen via my last post i got sexually assaulted nearly 7 days ago and i’ve been going off the rails ever since. i’ve barely been sober and have been promiscuous which i’ve never been before and i have no idea why after my assault all i want it for boys to respect me and say the right things before any sexual activity occurs. i had a boy say to me he wanted to get to know me before we had sex even though it was a one night stand and if it wasn’t for that nothing would of happened between us. it gave me at the time some false sense of security knowing i’m worth something and i’m not actually just a disposable machine that’s only good for one thing and that’s it? i went out last night and i’ll spare the details as about 5 different events happened all absolutely terrible and a lot of people fell out but i got a message from a friend saying to come to a party and i ended up calling him, the person who’s party it was i had a thing with for 6 months last year but he messed me around and got on girls in front of me, so my mate went to pass the phone to him and he hung up, didn’t think he wanted me to go from the start and i didn’t want to either i was saying no to going for days prior when mutual friends were asking me to go then i find out it wasn’t actually my friend messaging me it was someone who clearly didn’t like me and wanted me to show up just to be turned away so luckily that didn’t happen... until... i went to meet my other friend hours later who begged me to go back to the apartment with him and i said until you speak to the one who’s apartment it is it not going like i’m pretty sure he doesn’t even like me although i never done anything bad to him at all i’m pretty sure i loved him but so my friend calls and he passed the phone to someone else who says to bring me and whoever else so we show up just to be told no i can’t come in. i feel absolutely humiliated, i know a few of them don’t like me that’s evident and i’m not sure why because i’ve not personally met any of them that don’t seem to like me, a lot of it has to be because of the guy i used to see and another guy i used to see who was also there. there was also drama as on friday someone slyly took a picture of me with a boy who had his arm around me who has a girlfriend (which i didn’t know) so everyone knows it’s me but they’re only not saying anything because the boy would fight all of them and probably win and his girlfriend showed up and punched him in the face and said he cheated on her, so i was quite a big topic of conversation in that apartment clearly and it’s giving me such bad anxiety i’m just worrying what people think of me and what was said about me i just don’t know what to do... i feel like i need to redeem myself but yet i’ve just done nothing wrong?"
"i have this weird situation going on where nearly every morning now, after waking up around 3-4 a.m. i will be half-awake and trying to go back asleep, the problem is, that my mind is constantly telling me, your alarm is about to go off, you can't go back to sleep, and just all the things that run through my head before i fall asleep start to go through my mind. i am not laying awake with my eyes closed, but i am in a light dream with all of this going on? anyone have this problem too? i'm losing so much sleep because of it. update: happened again this morning. i was dreaming that i woke up and checked my phone and a girl replied, so was replaying a scenario of what i was gonna text back, over, and over, and over again. i finally realized that it wasn't actually happening and woke myself up."
"i have had fairly mild general anxiety for the past 4 years. it's always been manageable without the use of medicine. but recently, with a lot of stress and depression, my anxiety is spilling over into my social life. i'm convinced that, either as a result of my anxiety or because of the anxiety itself, every one of my friends is mad at me or can't stand me or even hates me. i typically don't care. i keep my circle small and typically i know the people i chose to have in my life love and care about me. but even that is crushing me. i have no reason to believe that my friends are talking about me behind my back, but i am convinced they are. i honestly don't know how to handle it."
i had a little numbness on my left side of my chest now im kinda bugging out while at work. and i cant stop thinking about it just want to know if thats normal for anyone. edit thank you all for your responses glad to know im not the only one feeling this way. i hope that you all can feel a little better.
"i've been battling depression, anxiety for about 15 years. i've also struggled with adhd all my life. on top of that i'm in my mid 30s and never been in a relationship so my self esteem is cripplingly low. lately at work my anxiety has been getting worse. i'm convinced that the people i work with think i'm a creepy loser and constantly talk about me behind my back and even text each other when i'm around. i'll dwell on it for hours and get a feeling of a knot in my chest. i also have trouble in social situations. i replay conversations in my head over and over again wondering if they found me strange. sometimes a memory of an embarrassing moment from years ago will just pop into my head and haunt me for a while. i've seen a therapist 4 times now but i'm starting to think she isn't equipped to deal with my issues. i think i may need to move to a psychiatrist and take a more clinical approach. i'm supposed to see a doctor next week to see if she'll put me on depression and anxiety medication, but i really don't know what to expect. i'm so tired of my mind going nonstop all day. i just want to stop obsessing over what people think of me."
"just like the title says, i have all these crazy thoughts and shit but when it comes down to it everything is fine. sometimes my anxiety is strong enough to drop out altogether. it's so weird. juggling like 2 thoughts but yeah, anyone experience this too?"
how do people cope?! my anxiety is like “you have a deadline” and my depression is like “it’d be really nice to just lay here all day”. it’s to the point where i’m submitting coursework an hour before it’s due because i have almost zero motivation but still get stressed because of the anxiety. i’ve been on propranolol and citalopram for about 11 weeks. the propranolol is great for the physical symptoms of anxiety but citalopram is doing nothing for my depression.
"my anxiety is new. never had it before 4-5 weeks ago (just turned 24 years old) and it's been a terrifying process to go through. starting with heart palpitations, chest tightness and shortness of breath i had every heart/lung test you can have and have come out clean on everything. doctor thought it might be anxiety. i don't know what triggers it, how long it will last or how to fix it yet, but just know that everyone posting here and sharing everything gives me comfort that this is manageable and that some of the physical symptoms i feel are totally normal and that i'm most likely not dying. tl;dr your sharing makes me feel normal and reminds me that i'm most likely not dying."
"i've honestly never asked anyone out before, being way too anxious to do so. i finally did last night and even though she rejected me i'm extremely proud of myself for fighting my fears. thought i'd share."
"good morning y’all. i’m currently on my way to my very first day at work and it’s nerve-racking to say the least! i’m all different types of emotions right now. happy, excited, and nervous as hell. anyway, my job is as an it person and i have to assist customers with tech problems over the phone. i’m in a small, open office and i hate talking on the phone when people are right next to me. i just hate when people are listening to me talk over the phone, it makes me super anxious. but, i’m going to power through today. i hope it goes well and i can get through it because it would be a huge milestone for me. edit: wow. thank you guys so much. i kept rereading these throughout the day at points and you all made me feel so much better. the day went well!"
"this is really just a note to myself. i consider myself a pretty smart guy. i knew the word ""anxiety"". i knew what it meant. i know people with anxiety issues. heck anxiety runs deep in my family tree. for some reason i never made the connection to myself. i finally have a word for how i feel. now things in my life make a little more sense. now i can start dealing with my thoughts/feelings in appropriate ways."
"one of the biggest fears of my life is getting scolded. i fear getting scolded more than i fear my future career. even if i know, deep down, that the other person is nice and probably understanding, i get so nervous about it that it affects my ability to do work. i submitted something in late and i was so sure my boss was going to blow up on me that i paced around for hours at home, but he called and was very understanding. it's exhausting having to live life as a panicky mess. i was scolded once by a strict coach when i was 15 and it took me actual years to get over it. after that one encounter, i was so scared that i would get heart palpitations and have to be physically forced to go to practice."
"i think about death all the time. everything i do at this point i ask myself why? it won't matter when i'm dead. i keep thinking how i could die tonight, to tomorrow or in my 20's or in my 40's or just go into cardiac arrest before i finish posting this. what if i'm dead before this year ends? what if i'm dead before i meet a girl, or have kids, or hell what if i die before the next time i get to eat a steak or smoke a cigar. does anyone else have this? if so how do you cope? thanks. and sorry if i rambled."
"i adopted my cat as a kitten when i was in grad school. i would not be where i am in my life without his love. pets hold a special place for people with anxiety. he was there providing comfort when i had bad days. he gave me purpose when i felt i had none. he gave me unconditional love. i didn’t have to worry about my insecurities around him. he loved me as i was. he was with me when i hit my rock bottom. he was with me during my years long recovery cheering me on and providing support during the low times. he gave me companionship when i would isolate because the world was too much to take. he was my spirit animal. he had anxiety too and took prozac. he was excited when i got home and would cry when i left, sometimes when i even just left the room. he loved me and i loved him and i will forever miss him and cherish the blessing he was in my life."
"for some reason i've already hated babers and getting my hair cut, maybe it's the masculine culture behind it or something. anyway i'm the type of person who would get 1 cut a year, when my hair gets long, my anxiety increases and i'm too anxious to even get a haircut. yesterday i found a men's stylist with an online booking, which was perfect as it meant no calling or waiting around for a cut. had the cut today and it was the best hair cut experience i've ever had, my hair now looks good and my confidence has skyrocketed, like everything since getting that cut has been amazing. although getting a cut might not be a big deal to some of you, i thought i'd share anyway to give you an uplifting story :)"
"i'll be fine one minute but then out of nowhere i go really lethargic and feel like i'm not living reality. it started happening when anxiety took its hold of me so i'm guessing they are related? hate living with this, everyday my heart races in scenarios i'm not used to, does anyone have any tips to ease the suffering, i've had this since the age of 14. thanks in advance."
"was at a con. there was an event. it was *very* full and i felt super overwhelmed. a friend asked if i was okay and i started to have a panic attack. he lead me to a side room. asked if i wanted space. said yes. sat there for some time. friend came back in to check on me. i said the attack was over and i felt out of it. said i'd go to the shop and get a drink. when i get back, my boyfriend is coming out the door. he hugs me and explains they thought i'd disappeared and hurt myself. there was a miscommunication and somehow, all anyone seemed to know was that i felt overwhelmed befits the game and looked kind of out of it. boyfriend was terrified and kinda angry that i didn't tell him. was hurt that i didn't tell him. but honestly, i was thinking only of the panic during the attack. apparently i was out of it for at least an hour, then went to get a drink while still out of it so i wasn't thinking straight. i caused an event to be interrupted, scared many people, and i'm humiliated. i feel like such a piece of shit."
"i have a question because i'm not sure if this is just me. i've always had social anxiety, even since i was a really little kid. the farthest back i can remember having anxiety about interacting with people was around 5yo. i remember around 13, i wouldn't be able to walk down the same sidewalk if someone was coming the other way. i'd cross the street so i wouldn't have to interact with them. now for my adult life, i'm still experiencing it i think. i talk to people easily now but i have something i can only describe as a rebound effect. i can talk to someone and have a really great conversation but then for the next few days have anxiety and panic attacks because i feel almost like i gave too much of myself away, even if the conversation was totally normal. it's not like i become very vulnerable at all. it's like if anyone knows anything more than bare basics about me or my perspectives or behaviors, i feel like i have to hide from the world. does anyone else experience this? i'm definitely going to talk to my therapist about it next time i see him, but i wanted some advice."
"i feel alone and useless unless i'm high or drunk. i might be failing classes at this point, or at least close to, but i can't go to class unless i'm on something without feeling like i want to kill myself or just give up completely. i'm even high right now, i haven't been sober in over a week."
"like i can have 5 consecutive great days of my baseline anxiety being very manageable (like a 2/10) then i relax and chill all day in bed netflix binging. by the end of the day my anxiety starts slowly escalating and now i'm at like a 7/10 anxiety wise. and i didnt do anything but relax all day yet this adrenaline builds up. makes no sense. theres no external stimulus causing me anxiety through the day (im watching tv or videogaming) so why is it ramping u... anyone get this, or understand why this happens?"
"i needed to sell a university textbook as i' am desperate for cash and unable to work. i sent my first parcel after all these years of fearing the post office, and even spoke to the guy at the counter who was probably wondering why i was shaking so much. i'm proud of myself, even if it took me hours and a panic attack to mentally prepare myself to go."
"i am just posting this to ease the minds of people who have gad who sometimes wonder whether it is ""real"" as a disability or not or whether we are making it up, its in our heads, etc.. i came across the stat as i was writing a formal letter requesting an extension on a deadline for my section 8 voucher because of my gad. i was googling whether it was considered a disability or not (i already knew it was...), and i came across that stat which exemplifies how disabling it can be."
"i have had 5 jobs in the last 4 years. i quit every single one of them, usually within a week of commencing. the longest i’ve stayed in a job has been 6 weeks. employment has been my biggest hurdle in my adult life. i become so anxious at work, i start to panic and lose the ability to concentrate. my body goes into fight or flight and i just simply run away and don’t look back. then the guilt, and depression hits me hard. after a good two years of no employment and being on horrible government benefits that constantly threatened to cut and suspended my payments due to not being seen as disabled enough to not work due to my mental health.... i’ve finally had enough. i took my own steps, i went out of my way and i applied for a job in a hospital. i got an interview and have been accepted and started just today! i have a week of training and then it’s all me looking after a ward. i’ll be doing the afternoon/night shift 3 days a week as an administrator maintaining paper work and discharging/admitting patients. my employer is well aware of my hurdles with my mental health and said she is very supportive so fingers crossed i can keep at this and build my confidence up! i know i will have my ups and downs, the anxiety will hit me hard some days more than others but i just have to remember how good working is for my mind and how we all start somewhere. i am proud of myself, it’s so good to be able to say that for the first time in a long time. thank you everyone on this subreddit for being so supportive. i hope to read lots of progress stories on here :)"
"i haven't beat my anxiety, and i don't think that is ever possible. it's important to understand that anxiety is natural, and everyone experiences it; anxiety is a human emotion and it is natural to feel it. for some of us, it can be detrimental to our life however. i apologize if there are any grammatical or spelling errors. tl;dr: eat varied vegetables, exercise everyday, meditate, detach yourself from mental clutter, be aware of your drug intake, pay attention to the moment, engage in flow, seek anxiety and confront it. **nutrition** you are what you eat. if you are neglecting your diet you are neglecting your mind. personally, i have had a lot of success by implementing certain foods and being aware of the effect that these foods have on my body. tl;dr: eat vegetables, supplement magnesium ,abstain from caffeine or supplement l-theanine, learn about your gut microbiome, consume less sugar and eat more vegetables, consume sufficient fats. * magnesium: magnesium relaxes the body and helps contribute to a healthy electrolyte balance. personally, i noticed a severe reduction in my tremors and baseline anxiety level once i started to supplement magnesium glycinate. * caffeine: this appears to be obvious, but i feel like a lot of people do not think about this. excessive caffeine levels increase the amount of mental noise i have, which results in higher levels of anxiety. * l-theanine: a natural amino acid that is found in green tea. if you do choose to consume caffeine, combine 200mg theanine with your caffeine dosage to help combat any anxiety. also works splendidly as a study aid. * gut microbiome: i am not going to pretend to thoroughly understand this complicated system. but, from my understanding we have a second ""brain"" in our stomach. the bacteria that we choose to feed within our stomach has a feedback system, which fuels certain cravings and can change our mental state. this is why your anxiety may peak after a round of anti-biotics, you have eliminated all the bacteria in your stomach, and if you eat a diet rich in sugars or simple carbs you will have fed the bad bacteria. if your gut is populated by these bad bacteria, it will have repercussions on your mental health. * microbiome practical advice: consume more fiber and vegetables to feed good bacteria. consume more probiotics rich foods such as kimchi, kefir, saurkraut, and kombucha. favoid simple carbohydrates such as sugars, white bread, etc. avoid alcohol. consider supplementing a probiotics, examine.com is a fantastic resource to find the right supplement for you. **lifestyle** tl;dr: exercise every day, no matter what you do; meditate every day; assess your drug use and understand if you are using them as a tool or a escape. * exercise: start exercising more. in the slight edge the author jeff olson talks about momentum, and consistency. your goals are just do something, every single day. it is alright if you have a terrible workout, or if you only did a 15 minute walk. the goal is to create habits in regards to exercise, which will be easier to do if you reinforce this habit every day. on days that i really do not want to go to the gym, i tell myself that i only need to walk in and start doing one lift, if i still want to leave, i let myself leave. * **meditation**: key! anxiety comes from repeated negative thought loops, and a rejection of emotions. if i tell you that you can think about anything, but do not think about a white polar bear, you will find it almost impossible to not give the polar bear attention. by resisting the idea of a polar bear, you are forced to pay attention to it. anxiety works the same way. when you try to force a thought out of your head, you give it attention, which creates a negative thought loop. meditation allows us to practice being mindful. instead of thinking about our anxiety or the negative thought, you divert your attention to the sense (hearing, sight, physical sensations). this allows us to acknowledge the negative thought, and move on. * meditation continued: there a two types of thinking going on. you have mental noise: these are thoughts that arise spontaneously and we have no control over. for some people these are very negative. behind this mental noise we have the observer however, this is you. when you are engaged in a activity that creates flow, your mental noise is reduced, and the observer has complete control. engaging in mediation allows us to get in contact with this observer, separating us from our mental noise. * drug use: this is a complicated subject, and if you do choose to consume drugs please make sure to properly educated yourself through erowid, or the different subreddits here. drugs take away what they give you. if you are consuming marijuana to run from your negative feelings, you may find that you are unable to cope with them sober. personally, i know that weed significantly contributes towards my anxiety. it causes me to overthink and sit in my head, rather than in the environment around me. mushrooms, lsd, and dmt have been the most effective means for me to solve my anxiety. if you choose to consume these drugs however, please be aware that these are powerful psychoactive substances that can have repercussions on your mental well being. physically, they are incredibly safe. personally, they allowed me to view my life free from the ego, which let me adopt a healthier mindset. if you are using drugs (which includes alcohol) to escape your negative feelings, you are not solving the problem. it is in the background, unsolved and growing. **techniques** tl;dr: try to observe your thoughts, engage in flow, take time to be mindful about your physical sensations, separate the observer and the mind. * noting: this creates a barrier between the observer, and your mental noise. when you feel anxiety, be aware of the physical sensations. think ""this is my body feeling anxiety, my bodies faces is flushed, my hands are shaking, and there is a pressure in the back of my head"". this allows you to understand that your body and mind may act seperately. * you are not your thoughts: your thoughts are not completely true and are built upon heuristics. just because you believe that your coworkers are talking about you, this does not make it true. our brains are incredible, but they are oftentimes inaccurate. * mindfulness: again, the goal is to dwell less in our brains, and focus more on the present moment. there is no past or future, the only thing that truly exists is the present moment. when your anxiety is peaking, take time to focus on the sensation of your breath, rub your fingers together and be aware of the feeling, do anything that grounds you with your physical sensation. * watch your brain: take the time every day to just let your brain think. don't try to control your thoughts or empty your brain, just wait and see what your next thought will be. if it is negative, don't reject the thought. follow the thought as far as your mind wants to, and move on when you notice another thought arise. again, this creates a barrier between you and your mind. * flow: have you ever played a game where you are completely in the moment? maybe the ball was just thrown to you, and your body seems to react automatically. this is flow, and it is a important part of our mental well-being. you can achieve this state through many different activities, take the time to find the ones that you can find flow in. **the importance of fear**: courage isn't the absence of fear, but the ability to recognize your fear and act anyway. by engaging in activities that give you anxiety, you will find that your anxiety is often times unfounded. this sounds difficult, but honestly the best thing you can do with your anxiety is to push yourself. take baby steps, don't jump into the deep end. you will be controlled by your anxiety if you don't push the levels a bit. if you have social anxiety, start talking more online. make small talk with the cashier. find whatever baby steps work for you. **therapy**: you are not weak if you consult a therapist. please, if you are really struggling go and try to talk to some different therapists. they are generally wonderful people who just want you to live a happy, fulfilled life. **recommended reading:** siddhartha by herman hesse meditations by marcus aurelius the power of now by eckhart tolle the subtle art of not giving a useless by mark manson the slight edge by jeff olson the feeling good handbook by david burns. these are some of the things that have helped me, hopefully you find something that can help you as well. if you have any suggestions or something that you would like to comment on, please do."
