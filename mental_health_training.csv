about 2 weeks ago i told my parents about my anxiety. i thought i'd let you guys know i am getting help from my therapist for the first time today. wish me luck!,Anxiety
"this seems to happen to me a lot. i was blessed with a kick ass immune system, but i'm always freaking out about getting sick, especially before a big event. i have prom on thursday and i've felt shitty since sunday from what i think are nerves. my symptoms are: -weak body (hard to describe) -lower back stiffness -nausea (but in my throat, not stomach if that makes any sense at all) -overall not feeling well but can't really describe the feeling. but it feels absolutely awful like i might as well have the flu or something -throat tightness -rushes where i feel like i'll throw up but never do (i'm severely emetephobic and have only thrown up 3/4 times in my 18 years on this planet, all of them &gt;5 years ago.) -not feeling comfortable unless i'm in my bed or in the bath -difficulty sleeping -feeling like i have a fever but i don't -tense legs -feeling helpless and like if i were to get sick no one could help me i think i have allergies right now but i'm so worried that it's a cold. i'm also scared i'll throw up either now or before prom or i'll feel sick for prom and have my day ruined. is it really possible that how i feel physically is really just all in my head and due to anxiety?? does anyone else get this? how can i stop it?",Anxiety
"every morning since classes started up again, i wake up, and after a few seconds, the nausea sets in. it almost feels like a miniature panic attack. i really hate it, it messes up the rest of my day :(",Anxiety
"i have been getting more and more panic attacks recently and my mum thinks i fake them to be dramatic and get attention. i was having a pretty huge one and she hit me over the head twice quite hard whilst calling me pathetic which obviously just made it worse. shes been hitting me since i can remember. she doesnt beat me on the regular just when ive really annoyed her which makes me hesitant to tell anyone. today i told my grandma what she did and she completely took my mums side saying ""sometimes a slap helps you snap out of it"" i couldnt be more angry as this entire conversation arose because they were talking about how to deal with my little sisters anxiety which is apparently all my fault. yeah the double standards when being a middle child are great... i dont know what to do ive been gaslighted my entire life not to mention my stepdad is a police officer. ive got no family members who will support me but i cant go one like this. my mum needs to know what she is doing is wrong.",Anxiety
"holy schnikes. i feel like a new man. i've been working non-stop for the past 2 weeks. today at lunch, i got so anxious that i went to the restroom and had a ""mini"" panic attack for 5 minutes. i felt so anxious all day. tonight, i hit the treadmill for 30 minutes, walking fast and jogging for a minute or two. i feel like a new man. it totally dialed down my anxiety. if you're not doing cardio, try it. it may change your life. **update: 17 hours later and i still feel great.",Anxiety
"i have a few things bothering me a lot at the moment and very much need some serious advice. when i was 4/5, i was sitting on my dad's lap helping him steer a car into the back yard, i suddenly felt something hard against my backside, he then asked if i could feel it, and i said yes, we then got out of the car. my mum then asks why he had an erection, he tells mum that i was sitting on his lap. she then starts to get jealous and asks what was wrong with her, and they have a small argument before she walks inside, leaving me alone with him. he then asks me to come towards him, with a very deivant expression, i suddenly felt anxious, and say no before running inside and going to my bedroom. he then follows me inside, and enters my bedroom. my mum and myself yell at him to leave me alone, him and mum have another small argument before he drives off. mum then comes into my bedroom later to tell me not to tell anyone about what happened, because people will come to take me away. then, when i was about 11/12 he would enter the bathroom while i was showering everyday, even though i expressed to him that i wanted my privacy many times. i asked him to stop, i asked my mum to talk to him. the bathroom door would be closed (no lock), but he would still come in. his reasons for entering would change, sometimes it was to wash his hands, to check his face in the mirror (which was located directly in front of the mirror), or to just have a chat because he hadn't seen me all day. i would complain to my mum everyday, and she would just say she would talk to him, or even said that i always showered while he was home so i must want him to look at me. these memories have been causing me a great deal of stress, but i'm confused about if they're serious, and if i should be worried about them? i have two young daughters myself now, and i'm worried about their safety around my parents. am i overreacting or do i have something to worry about?",Anxiety
i know it’s hard to talk about feelings and especially anxiety. i myself suffer as well and found it helpful to talk to others and build a support system. no one should have to deal with it on their own and know there are people out there to help.,Anxiety
"i constantly feel like i’m being lied to. i overanalyze things, my brain always finds a way to twisted things people say so it seems like a lie. my head hurts and i often cry. things started to feel like this since i was being cheated on 6 years ago.",Anxiety
"so in my bigger lecture classes, i generally keep to myself and the classes are so big that it doesn't make much of a difference. smaller classes i would stress out a lot more about it but in bigger classes, i just have my misophonia to worry about. but yesterday, my class got moved and i was walking into the building to look for is and saw another girl heading in the same direction, so i asked if she was heading to the same place and she said yes, so i walked with her. we walked in silence for a little bit, then i finally worked up the courage to try and start a conversation with her by asking what her major is. and somehow, we got to talking for the full 20 minutes before class starts! i've never had such a lovely conversation with a stranger so easily, and we connected on a lot of things. i don't know if i'll ever see her again because the class is so big, but i was just happy to have someone to talk to and this has never happened before.",Anxiety
"j. cole is in denver and i couldn't find anyone to go with. i uselessing love j cole and i'm sick of relying on other ppl to do and see the shit i want. so useless it, i bought a ticket and am going solo. i know my anxiety and self awareness will come up but i think once the show starts i'll be too indulged to care. wish me luck :p",Anxiety
"whenever there is a change of plans, i almost always feel an extreme punch to my gut. i typically end up making it worse by immediately jumping to saying i don’t want to do the plans anymore or getting upset with the person. it’s especially hard in my relationship. even if i’d be perfectly fine with having the night to myself, if it’s the same day change in plans i feel like i can’t breath or i need to scream. jumping outside my bubble, i know i’ll enjoy my time alone but my mind immediately goes to feelings of rejection, extreme anxiety, and the need to close off immediately. i just want to jump in a hole forever and find myself in a major low for the rest of the day. this leads to even more disconnect with my partner. in the moment, i feel like pinching myself or really biting my inner cheek. someway to get out the anxiety. have you all found a way to 1. get that anxiety out immediately 2. not hurt your partner with words said/finding peace in a new change of plans. any advice at all would really really help. i’m having a really tough time.",Anxiety
"the older i get, the worse i seem to be at, i don't know, functioning in general. i used to be really sociable, have plenty of friends, i did well in school, had hobbies and interests - i was weird, but enough people liked me that i didn't think about it. after high school it was like the blinders were taken off and i started to see all these things about myself that i really, really hated. i started struggling a lot in social situations, i flunked out of a really good university, i couldn't hold a job, i gradually lost contact with my friends... i was a mess. but i got back up. it was a little harder than before but i still had enough momentum to keep going. i moved back to my old school's city after a semester away, ready to do what i had to in order to re-enroll, but things got worse. i had a *lot* of anxiety already, and you know how people are - they pick up on that. i reconnected with my friends for a little while but then they all ghosted me because i was starting to act a little crazy. i got very depressed and almost did something irreparably bad to myself. so back with mom and dad. again. starting at another school. again. i got overwhelmed and started having panic attacks before classes and pulled out. i got a job and worked full time, but i was not good at it, my co-workers didn't like me much, and i was fired after a year. so i'm back in school yay. except i'm only in two classes and still struggling. everything is just... *so hard* and it's exhausting and frustrating and humiliating. i had high hopes for myself, but i don't see how to salvage any of that from what i've let myself become. i think a big part of my problems is that i'm so used to trying and failing that i'm afraid that's the only outcome if i try again. i look at myself and think ""i've given up,"" because i have. i don't want to! but i don't know how to make life work for me anymore. i don't know how to connect with people. i go out somewhere and it's impossible to think or talk clearly through the static in my head that makes me nauseous and stutter and my heart pound. what kind of a life is one where you can't even talk to someone without turning into an idiot or crying after? i can't function like this. i'll never be able to work like this. has anyone overcome a similar situation?",Anxiety
"i (26 m) am by no means saying that i still don’t feel anxious now and then but i have definitely regained control of my life. i am now living the life that i want to live. no longer is anxiety holding me back from doing anything in life i want to. i am going to try my best to list of a few key points that helped me get to where i am today i no for a fact that i am going to miss out a lot of information just for the fact that it has took a shit ton of little things to get me to where i am. taking time to heal: 1 year ago i made the hard decision to take a break from my toxic job to focus on my own health, this was a super hard decision to make but it enabled me to take the time i need to push myself out of my comfort zone and focus on myself. consistently exercising and eating better: i had no self confidence and was always exhausted so i used to eat junk food most nights just because i felt like shit and the food made me feel worse, now i eat much cleaner, no caffeine alcohol or sugary drinks stopped smoking especially cannabis, i still treat myself of a weekend to what ever i want but for the most part i plan my meals in advance and make sure i eat them throughout the week. and the benefits of exercise are well documented but could not be underestimated. sleep: this was harder than you might think for me and i massively underestimated its value, i have never been a good sleeper usually getting anywhere from 2/5 hours sleep a night was not uncommon, but after a lot of self experimenting what works best for me i have finally got it under control i am now getting between 7/8 hours a night and the difference is chalk and cheese, when you wake up refreshed from a nights sleep there is no better feeling. took a break from ‘soical media’: i deleted all social media accounts (except reddit) and to be honest i have not got them back and i don’t think i will, people portray an image of themselves to the world that they want them to see not their real selves, and it can make you compare yourself to other people which in my opinion is not healthy, focus on yourself. perseverance: not everything you try is going to succeed, over these 8 years i have tried and failed more timed than i could ever count, but i always try again the next day, small victories are the key, i would push myself every day to do something i was uncomfortable doing, some days i would fail but i would try again until i could complete what i had set out to do then more. take experience and tips and tricks from people who have been there before: there is an old saying i can not remember where i heard it but it goes ‘ no man is your friend, no man is your enemy, every man is your teacher’, and basically my interpretation of it is you can learn from any and everyone, and that is what i did i did my own research and reached out to anyone with knowledge about anxiety and panic attack’s and see what they knew about it that i didn’t. i am not writing this to gloat i am writing this so that if even 1 person out there who thinks there is no way out or that life can never go back to ‘normal’ i am living proof that there is, better days are ahead. i hope anyone reading this might find it usually or insightful and if you have any questions leave them below and i will try my best to answer as best as i can.",Anxiety
"felt horrible when i read the news, with the fears that many have about potential war. although i live in australia, i’m still scared about the outcomes. speaking to my dad, he reassures me this isn’t a global conflict (china and russia, and other major players being unlikely to join the war). nevertheless, i understand even a war between iran and the us wouldn’t impact me definitively but the fear of escalation is still tingling me even after the initial shock. i feel like i felt when i heard about the india/pakistan news a couple months ago. the same feeling of when ww3 was trending on twitter a couple years ago. knowing those have not led to the wars that people perhaps fear-mongered about is some respite from the aftermath of the panic. don’t know if i’m looking for people to tell me it’s alright, telling me the straight truth or telling me a white lie to feel better (what i think my dad does at times, or others in other posts). the rational part of me tells me not to worry about this, as even if it eventuates to my worst fears, i’ll be worrying about it twice. with a pretty important interview in a couple of days, i’m trying to stick that, but not sure how i’ll cope as more news comes out (although i’m making myself keep off it).",Anxiety
"so i am starting to venture out of the house after having a very hard time leaving my 2 floor walkup apartment for almost a year now. tonight i accomplished getting to my favorite bookstore which is just around the corner for the first time since last spring! and guess what? here's what happened: i didn't faint. i didn't die. i didn't let lightheadedness/dizziness/depersonalization and derealization stop me from having a great night out! i got to speak to some friends i haven't seen in months. bought myself some books because i can, and can't wait to read them! and my husband who was with me got me a beautiful dreamcatcher that was hanging in the window that has actual carnelian crystals (one of my faves!) in it! this is after about a year (and more) of intense depression and anxiety. (my best friend had died, parents moved away.) thank goodness for my husband who is my soul mate and best friend! (couldn't have done it without him!) recently, i started pushing myself to get outside more and more every day. today was a major milestone! spoke to people on the street. got myself some gifts. felt like my ""old self"". super freaking refreshing. just wanted to share w y'all that there is hope for us and the world!",Anxiety
"today was a really really good day, i left my house for like 11 hours!!! i got past my anxiety and just smiled through the day. i'm sitting on my couch right now after a long day away from home and i feel so calm and sort of relieved. i feel happy, happy that this day was actually really good. my god i almost never leave my house and when i do my head turns into chaos but today it was just calmness. i'm so so surprised. most of all i'm proud of myself :d i feel great!!!",Anxiety
"1. despite the buffoon serving as the american president, there are other elected officials and higher ups whose voices matter too. despite the words coming out of his mouth, he doesn't have a giant dashboard of buttons he can shoot missiles out of. stop watching so many movies. 2. war is costly. nobody wants it, and all the tough talk is just a big pissing contest. north korea would lose hard despite their big words. 3. civilian deaths are a big no-no for everyone, civilians' voices matter too, especially since many have international business relations. 4. despite what the media and the commenters on r/worldnews say, north korea sucks at launching missiles as a whole. they have failed to target multiple times. 5. look to the past. north korea has previously threatened both guam and hawaii, and is no stranger to threats. worse situations have happened in the past. just to list a few: the cuban missile crisis, the cold war, etc. and yet we are all still here. while the situation isn't a good thing, you and your friends will be fine. carry on with your daily lives.",Anxiety
"this should be a celebratory post but i've spent two days awake, shaking, throwing up or otherwise... i don't know if i can do it but i can't live the hell of staying in our 1 bedroom apartment any longer. i got hired at an oil and vinegar bar, and i really want to work there because i cook a lot and adore olive oil and i buy their products, but they want me to be a hard salesman, pull people in, explain a whole spiel about the chemistry and benefits of oil... and i'm dying inside tonight. the owner seems adamant about good training and told me not to spew bullshit if i didn't know it, cause you could be talking to a chemist and you might sound dumb, and i can't get that off my mind. except when i shopped there i dreaded when the employees bombed me with information. so yeah, i work at 2 tomorrow expecting to not last the 2 week probation period. everything i'm studying just gets lost in my head and i retreat back to my no window bedroom calm down. but i can't lose my car or stay in this house.",Anxiety
"as soon as i'm with a group i'm awkward and quiet. if i tell a story and more than one person is looking at me and listening, i become incredibly anxious. worst of all, my face becomes red as a tomato. it's so annoying. i absolutely dread having lunch with my coworkers but i would be happy to have a friendly, quiet lunch with one other person. in a group, i always end up being the person who talks the least. i wish i could just be a normal, social human. i just dislike being in a group of people, it makes me so uncomfortable.",Anxiety

"for the second time this year, i finished a major project for work, but instead of feeling relieved, i feel totally wound up. this is the side of anxiety that's so hard to explain to people who've never felt it: there is nothing wrong. nothing that needs to be done immediately. no deadlines. no projects at home. yet here i sit, my heart pounding and my mind haunted by a specter of dread. i try to take my mind off it by playing a computer game. but then i feel like i am putting of work. so i sit down to do work, but then i realize i am between projects. so i go outside to sit and relax. and my mind says, ""what are you just sitting around for?? there's so much to be done!"" my brain never turns off. it just keeps pecking at my sense of calm. don't stop working...you'll fall behind. don't take a break...there's more to do. don't eat out of boredom...you'll get fat. don't start that building project...you won't have time to finish it. people worry about something and say, ""oh, i have such anxiety!"" maybe you are anxious. but you do not have anxiety. anxiety is this unwelcome guest that stays in your bed with you, and follows you to work, and to the movies, and to the gym. and you beg it to go away. and when you think it has, you feel like something is missing...a part of you. and your chest tightens again, and the dread creeps back, and anxiety says, ""jk! i never left. i just wanted you to know how much you need me."" i don't need it. but i have it. and goddamn but how i want to get rid of it...",Anxiety
after having anxiety for as long as i can remember i finally started opening up about how i was feeling and got to a doctor. it's been one year on antidepressants and i feel uselessing amazing. they have been life changing. i haven't had a panic attack in a long time and i feel like i can finally live my life how i want to. yes i still have some anxiety here and there but useless has it changed. instead of feeling like i'm dying everytime i'm anxious and feeling like the whole world is against me i feel like i can manage it and over come it. just a happy story for ya. hope it gives you some motivation to get the help you deserve.,Anxiety

"came across news this morning that hip hop celebrity kid cudi checks himself into rehab for depression and suicidal thoughts. he wrote this letter to his fans where anxiety is mentioned. just wanted to say that none of us are alone in our fight with anxiety. here is the letter: ""its been difficult for me to find the words to what im about to share with you because i feel ashamed. ashamed to be a leader and hero to so many while admitting i’ve been living a lie. it took me a while to get to this place of commitment, but it is something i have to do for myself, my family, my best friend/daughter and all of you, my fans. yesterday i checked myself into rehab for depression and suicidal urges. i am not at peace. i haven’t been since you’ve known me. if i didn’t come here, i wouldve done something to myself. i simply am a damaged human swimming in a pool of emotions everyday of my life. theres a ragin violent storm inside of my heart at all times. idk what peace feels like. idk how to relax. my anxiety and depression have ruled my life for as long as i can remember and i never leave the house because of it. i cant make new friends because of it. i dont trust anyone because of it and im tired of being held back in my life. i deserve to have peace. i deserve to be happy and smiling. why not me? i guess i give so much of myself to others i forgot that i need to show myself some love too. i think i never really knew how. im scared, im sad, i feel like i let a lot of people down and again, im sorry. its time i fix me. im nervous but ima get through this. i wont be around to promote much, but the good folks at republic and my manager dennis will inform you about upcoming releases. the music videos, album release date etc. the album is still on the way. promise. i wanted to square away all the business before i got here so i could focus on my recovery. if all goes well ill be out in time for complexcon and ill be lookin forward to seeing you all there for high fives and hugs. love and light to everyone who has love for me and i am sorry if i let anyone down. i really am sorry. ill be back, stronger, better. reborn. i feel like shit, i feel so ashamed. im sorry. i love you, scott mescudi",Anxiety
"""the evening is a time to be calm,"" they said. ""monday is the worst part of the week."" i have never related to either of these statements for as long as i can remember. for as long as i can remember, in fact, if it is a sunday night before school, i have had the worst time of my life and never learn my lesson until i am in the moment (for example, right now.) sunday nights are the times that i have had my worst panic attacks and i have come to believe that whatever being may have created this earth, be it humanoid or not, leaves us every sunday night between 6:00pm and the end of my waking hours. i fear that my brain is too small to comprehend the reasons for their foul play.",Anxiety
"so the title sums it up. i'm almost 28, all my friends are engaged, married or have a clatter of children. i have never even had a boyfriend in my life. i've had ""friend with benefits"" who in reality were not friends and have not benefitted me. i can see now i was used a practice girl before they moved onto women they actually care about. i have social anxiety and hate myself so expect others to hate me too. things like eye contact are very difficult. i use alcohol as a tool to try and be fun but it never really works out. not fishing for compliments here just being straight up : i am not a good looking woman so this also doesn't help. last year i decided to take the plunge and started online dating as i find typing easier than talking. i went on my first ever date last year. i went on a few very unsuccessful ones but eventually found what i'm looking for. he is kind, funny, caring, compassionate and understanding of all my crazy. the first night he put his arms around me i freaked out - no one has ever done that to me before. then i realised what it was and it is the single happiest memory i have. i felt so safe and lucky to be the one he chose in that moment. on the night i plucked up the courage to say ""i love you"" for the first time in my life, he dumped me before i got that far. i'm not angry, i don't blame him, he just didn't feel the same way i do. it's left me absolutely broken. i believe im not good enough for anyone and don't see the point in going on anymore. i just go through the motions every day without feeling anything. i am on meds and see a doctor regularly but nothing helps. i tried counselling and could not talk. i have a history involving suicide and sexual assault and so trust is hard for me. i don't know where to go from here.",Anxiety

"so i'm pretty sure i've had anxiety issues since i was a teenager. when i was younger, i just thought some people were like that and it was a personality quirk. i can't even describe how little faith i have in my ability to do anything. i constantly worry that i'm doing the wrong thing. i have been having a particularly tough year (a brother with a terminal illness, career challenges, my own chronic illness, other stuff), and the anxiety i've been dealing with has been making it hard for me to function on a daily basis. after some urging from my husband and friends, i decided it was time to seek help. i never had anything against therapy, i just know that it takes a lot for me to trust someone and i was skeptical about how it would work for me. given all of the coronavirus stuff, i knew i wasn't going to be able to visit a new therapist at an office, so i looked into some apps and decided to try out betterhelp. i was matched with a therapist and we messaged a few times. it felt awkward, but i thought doing a live session would be better so i booked one. it was terrible. she showed up 10 minutes late to a 30 minute session and took forever between the shallow responses she was giving me. i told her about my brother who is fighting cancer before the live session, and she honestly asked about him and his support system more than she asked about me (which is important and important to me, but i feel like that should be saved for his therapy). i'm just so disappointed. it took so much for me to feel ready to get help, and i feel like i took a huge step back. i feel like there's no hope for me to feel better. i feel completely overwhelmed all of the time and somehow i'm still letting everyone down. i know it's ridiculous, but i feel like i couldn't even get therapy right. sorry for venting.",Anxiety

"i took the first step. i’ve been struggling so much for the past few months. it’s gotten to the point that i’m barely sleeping and when i do, i have insane nightmares. a couple weeks ago i booked a therapy appointment and it was today. i stood outside the building and came very close to just leaving because the idea of opening up about what i’m struggling with just seemed so overwhelming. i even started walking away, deciding i couldn’t do it. but 5 minutes after the appointment was set to begin, i went back, and i’m so glad i did. it was just the first appointment so it was a lot of sharing what i’m struggling with, but even just talking about it in a judgement-free zone has made me feel like a small piece of the weight has been lifted. and i’m so excited to continue on this process. what i’m trying to say is; if you’re wondering if you should start looking for a therapist, do it. if you’ve found a therapist that seems interesting but you’re not sure if you should reach out, do it. if you’ve made an appointment but you’re not sure if you should attend, attend it. and if you’re standing outside wondering if you should go in, go in. it will help, i promise.",Anxiety

"anyone else deal with this? in short, i always envision these scenarios that are horrible in my head. i envision them even when the facts i'm presented with don't back them up. i could even have the people involved in these scenarios tell me things are cool, yet i still can't get over these thoughts. they're a ridiculous burden. here's a perfect example, i'm self employed. yesterday morning i had a client question some work i did for him, he asked me to put together an email explaining things. i said i would and i did; i sent him the email yesterday. this morning i followed up with him. his exact words to me, ""everything makes sense to me. thank you. i'll pass it along and it'll make sense to them too."" that should, realistically, be the end of my thinking. the guy i was worrying about just told me everything was fine and that what i said made sense. instead of relaxing, i think these things : - ""he's not telling the truth, he's conspiring against me and just wants to make me feel safe. they're secretly unhappy and questioning me."" - ""his company is going to sue me, they're talking about going after me and just not telling me."" *i then begin to play out these overly detailed lawsuits in my head, even going through the conversations i would have with him about the lawsuit.* - ""he's going to drag my name through the mud and my business will go under."" - ""when my business goes under it's going to hurt my marriage, and my wife won't be happy ..."" i could go on and on. i literally had to sit on my couch last night trying to calm myself down because of this. all of this is stuff i build up, i know this, yet i can't deal with it rationally. i know full well that the facts i have don't back up my ridiculous thinking, yet it doesn't go away. anyone else deal with this? how do you manage/cope?",Anxiety

"hello all, i'm currently in a relationship with my boyfriend of 5 years. sometimes, i get so overwhelmed by how happy he makes me and how much i love him, that i get terrified. for some reason i feel like what we have is too good to be true, and i feel like the universe is going to try to get back at me, and something tragic is going to happen to him. i always have intrusive thoughts about him getting killed, or getting in an accident. it's awful and sometimes it prevents from being fully present in the relationship. sometimes it keeps me up at night. has anyone ever felt something similar? (also: my anxiety+depression is the most manageable it has been in years. i have been taking zoloft for about 2 months now, and i've never felt better. however, i still have a lot of worries about certain things, like my boyfriend's safety for example, that haven't completely gone away. thanks for any advice guys.)",Anxiety

"my worst case of anxiety i can remember was when i was 19 (29 now), and just like when i was 19 i am living with my father again for the first time in 10 years. i have been nearly*** anxiety attack free since i moved out of his place when i lived in ny. and felt even better when i moved to south florida. i started a whole new life alone which is something i never ever thought i could do. but my father has fallen on hard times, jobless and 62 he needed somewhere to stay. i have (had) a spare bedroom so i invited him down to stay with me and try to find work here. meanwhile i am supporting him financially which isn't my biggest bother. the problem is my anxiety i felt when i was 19 seems to be resurfacing. the strangest thing about it though, is when i feel like i'm on the verge of having an episode i see him as my safe person. though it seems he might be the reason for it in the first place. this strange phenomenon is something i just need to deal with for now, as his job hunt isn't going very well. i'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced this. tldr; my dad is the cause of my anxiety, but also my safe person when i feel like i'm having an anxiety attack 🤔",Anxiety

"so if you’re reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder, let me start by saying i know how you feel. i’ve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don’t stop, i’ve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end, i’ve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water, had the jitters and the lump in my throat. i’ve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. i’ve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times, i’ve had racing, intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. and i’ve felt like i was going crazy. a lot. but i’m here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. after almost a year of conscious and concerted effort, all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; i’ll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks, but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn’t really bug me. i was also on medication (an ssri since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off . so i wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety, mainly because i know i really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when i first sought help in late april of last year. if you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you’re at, scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold. i don’t discuss responses to specific symptoms here, just a general approach. if you’re looking for tactics for specific symptoms, check out the list of books i left in the second section. i think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom, but you can try the third if you don’t feel it makes enough of a difference. before you read, i want to mention something once so i don’t have to later on. recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. some days you’ll feel like you made incredible progress, and others you’ll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. it’s going to be a lot of two steps forward, one step back. sometimes it’ll even be two steps forward, two steps back. but even those times are okay, because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. just know that once you start to give effort, things will start gradually getting better. so here it is. my comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder. if you’re at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can’t calm down: at this stage, you’re either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have gad and are constantly anxious. i was diagnosed with gad and pure-o but i’ve had maaaaaany panic attacks, so i know this advice will work for both. **1.** stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. this is the basis of acceptance and commitment therapy (act) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. to do this: * don’t try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. this is infinitely easier said than done at first, but with practice you’ll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. when i was first having constant adrenaline rushes, i kept trying to consciously stop them. this was actually making things worse. the more you try to fight your symptoms, the more worried you become, which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones, causing your symptoms to become worse. the best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. * questions, doubts, and fear will come up. when they do, remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through, and try to rest in the anxiety. it may be difficult, but try to ease into the symptoms. this was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency. * if this isn’t working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won’t stop, ask for more. as the dare response (discussed later) puts it, run towards your symptoms. if you’ve ever read a book on act, this step is likely in there. when you ask your body to make your symptoms worse, you’ll find it can’t. the symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry, and not something you can control. keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease, then move on to step 2. in case you’re interested, the clinical term for this is “arousal reappraisal.” it’s not discussed very often, but i found it to be very helpful. **2.** do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. in older forms of anxiety treatment, this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic, but in the dare response, barry mcdonagh calls it being “engaged.” this basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. regardless of what level of anxiety you’re at, this is incredibly important. **your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it, so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** again, much easier said than done, and your mind will fight you at every stage. but it’s an integral part of recovery. when i first started out, i found short activities the most helpful, like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two, or doing homework. **3.** give it time. your system can’t sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. if you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you’ll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery. **4.** if recommended by your physician, a benzo might help. benzos are basically nervous system relaxants, but they’re no magic pill. when i took my first dose of valium, i didn’t feel a thing. it took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. benzos are fine to use in the very beginning, but i will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. benzos are not meant to be used in the long term, and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo, you’ll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. but since at this point, you’re in a constant state of panic, they’re a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety, so you can start focusing on the long term. **5.** journal. i don’t recommend this as much beyond this stage, as i’ve found it doesn’t really help all that much. but in the beginning stages of my experience with gad, i found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what i was going through. just write out whatever you’re thinking or feeling. it’s a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit. **6.** get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. walk around the block, take a stretch break at work. you don’t need to be doing a full workout at this point, just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you’re getting for something productive. **7.** this one may seem rather minor, but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. it’s much easier to feel short of breath when you’re in a position that doesn’t let you breath easily. if you’re lying down, lay on your back. if you’re sitting, sit up straight. once you’ve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks), you can move on to the next step. constant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks: if you’re at this phase, you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety, like jitters, nausea, jelly legs, shortness of breath, and so on. but you’re not in constant freakout mode anymore. you can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time, you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. you may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. so here’s what to do at this stage: **1. start reading or listening to books on what you’re going through**. the more you understand the subtleties of what’s going on in your brain and body, the better you’ll be able fix them. read up on therapy techniques as they’ll be your quickest route to recovery. in the end, this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. when you’re knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal, you can try everything and see what works best for you. in fact, i found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. like your anxiety, the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized, but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on audible, which is how i consumed them): * the dare response. phenomenal book written by someone who’s been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. his techniques are a combination between act and a little cbt. i would especially recommend this book if you’re at the higher end of the anxiety scale. * feeling good: the new mood therapy. this book is considered the gold standard of cbt. it’s aimed at treating depression, but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. i listened to the whole thing, then picked out the chapters i thought applied to me. it’s long, so i don’t think you need to do the first part, but there’s a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over. * rewire your anxious brain. this one is 1/4 cbt, 1/4 lifestyle guidance, and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. i like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do, and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful. * the subtle art of not giving a useless. this one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before, and i really like it. it serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren’t worth giving a useless about. fair warning: mark manson describes ocd as “an incurable disease” in this book. he’s not a doctor or therapist and isn’t really knowledgeable on the subject, so i’d take that section with a grain of salt. but the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless. remember, the point of these books isn’t to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself. **2.** get into therapy. this is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety, and for good reason. once you find a therapist who you work well with, you’ll notice you progress much more quickly. some things to look out for when you screen your therapist: * are they nice? kind of an obvious one but worth going over. do you feel like they take what you’re saying seriously? are their answers usually thoughtful and caring? * are they experienced? my first therapist was tremendously nice and caring, but he didn’t know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics, like square breathing. * are they accessible? or do you have to drive two hours to see them? are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month? it may take a while until you find a therapist who’s right for you, but this is a person you’ll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. i would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. **3.** continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. these are things that i remind myself of even now. the more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms, the more quickly they’ll dissipate. in addition, if you can, start easing off your benzo a little bit. if you’re taking it three times a day, try to move down to two. if you’re down to two a day, try one. **4.** start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term: * cardiovascular exercise. it’s said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you’re anxious, but i’d like to look at it from the opposite perspective. when you’re anxious, your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. if you don’t dump it out somehow, the symptoms will inevitably get worse. so getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. if you’re not super exercise savvy, my suggestion is to get out and walk, jogging occasionally. walking is great for releasing excess energy, but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. you don’t need to do sprints whenever you run, but you’ll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. more on this later. * meditation. the reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. it also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you’re having so you can learn to catch and correct them. keep in mind, the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. in fact, it’s almost the opposite. while meditating, your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. a really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds, and you’re just watching them pass by. there is plenty of information out there on how to meditate, and it includes helpful techniques like noting, so i won’t go into it that much here. make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first, then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. i suggest trying out the meditation app calm. * diet. if you’re reading this, you’ve probably read the do’s and don’ts of your diet about a hundred times, but i’ll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine, no alcohol. try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods, and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. one of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. it is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation, though the research isn’t entirely there yet. regardless, try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. you can also take a magnesium supplement (i’ll defer to the dare response for information about it), though again, research is shaky so this alone won’t bring change. * medication. this one will be completely at you/your doctor’s discretion. some people respond well to antidepressants, some don’t. i didn’t feel like they helped me all that much, but you might. note, the purpose of antidepressants isn’t to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. this is a really important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won’t change anything on their own. only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. medication only makes it happen more quickly. **5.** give it time. your nervous system doesn’t change overnight. it may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. so just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through. once you’ve been at these things for a while, you’ll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase. hovering around 4 - 6: if you’re at this stage, congratulations! the first two stages are really hard to break out of, and if you did, it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. so give yourself a pat on the back. once you’ve reached this stage, your anxiety likely doesn’t manifest itself physically as much. you may still get nauseated occasionally, but most of the time you’re able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. you’ve started reclaiming your normal life. you get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. but you’re still really anxious whenever you go out. in addition, though your physical symptoms may have eased up, your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. so here’s what you should do at this stage: **1.** keep staying the course. it’s easy to flounder or stop, and it’s okay if you do. but remember to pick up right where you left off. also, don’t beat yourself up for making mistakes. everyone falters from time to time, it’s part of what makes us human. and it’s okay if things are taking longer than you expected. take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work, things will get better. **2.** keep pushing the envelope. identify areas of your life that you’ve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. i used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since i was a little kid. i’d find flaws in every interaction i had with others and nitpick every little thing. once i started working on this, i noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations, but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. this is part of how exposure and response prevention (erp) therapy works. you expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up, and use cbt techniques to curb your conscious worry. an important note about this is **these experiences aren’t meant to be fun**. if you’ve got social anxiety and you’re challenging yourself by going to meet new people, it’ll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. people around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. but you’ll slowly notice improvement, and with time, it’ll become more and more natural over time. **3.** along the same lines, start making your workouts more difficult. run/bike/swim for longer, lift heavier weights. when you’re anxious, you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life, sometimes without realizing it. the only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. i saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of “i’ve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two, why aren’t i seeing my anxiety improve?” and the answer in this case is because this person wasn’t pushing him/herself. if you continue to do the same things, you shouldn’t expect to see improvement. **4.** start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. for a lot of us (me included), this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. it’s okay to cave every once in a while at this stage, but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. one of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety, which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. i stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year, and my condition got much better as a result. if you’re seriously concerned about something, visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them, but once they diagnose you, do not second guess it. i spent my entire college career going to different doctors (i think at least 10 or 11 different types, sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). i was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find, but the true culprit was anxiety. if you **feel** like you’re constantly sick or dying, yet doctors can’t find anything wrong, this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. you can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (i personally used the cbt method outlined in feeling good), but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn’t mean it’s true. **5.** give it time. i’ve said it before but it’s important to reiterate. recovering from this stage might take several months, so try your best to be patient. and remember, if things aren’t the way you want them to be now, they will be soon. i think it’s also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**, which you may have come across in your book reading, as i think understanding it will be really helpful. google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience, but since that’s kind of vague, i’ll give my own definition. cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. in other words, you’re using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. one example of this is if you’re someone who criticizes themselves too much. you might tell yourself “that conversation was so awkward, so that person must think i’m a loser.” in this case, whether or not the situation was awkward, you don’t know what the other person is thinking. i used to think this a lot until i realized people really didn’t see me that way, and all the worrying i did was for nothing. a healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety. at this stage, i had the most trouble with mental symptoms, namely the feeling of going crazy. i thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations, i always second guessed my own sanity, i thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts i was having were a sign of schizophrenia, and anytime i was happy, i thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. this is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: i thought i was going crazy, so to me that was evidence that i really was. if you think this describes you, it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. is it more logical that your psychiatrist, therapists, family, and friends are correct when they say you’re not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety, or that you’re the one person out of the fifty who’s somehow figured out you’re losing it? this applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. remember: **just because you think something doesn’t make it true**. one of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that i was paying so much attention to them. at this point in recovery, it’s absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied, especially when you’re most anxious**. i found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. i suggest doing the same, as they’re both productive and beneficial in the end. eventually, your mind will calm down on its own and you’ll find your own solutions to these symptoms. i find that at this point the really important thing really is time. once i felt like i was going crazy for the hundredth time, i realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm, this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. this stage took about 3 months to recover from, but once i did, i hit the next stage. anxiety is 1 - 3 most days, with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free: you’re in the home stretch. this is it. you’re likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you’ve done, but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you’ve come. for me, having a day where i go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something i wouldn't have been able to do even before my anxiety disorder. certainly not anything i’d ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. seriously, if you’ve hit this point, the light should be at the end of the tunnel. and on the days where it’s a little harder to deal with, let me reassure you: you’re almost home free. note: your symptoms will still be present at this point. some of the intrusive thoughts might still come, sometimes you’ll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack, but you know how to deal with these things. your moments of panic don’t last more than a few seconds, and your symptoms don’t really illicit a response from you. at this stage: **1.** you know what works best for you. keep doing it. you have your techniques and you’ve clearly demonstrated they work. all that’s left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. on the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4, remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you’ll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. **2.** slowly lose your crutches. if you discuss your anxiety with your friends, stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. if you’re still occasionally taking benzos, slowly taper off. the more of your independence you get back, the more confident you’ll feel. **3.** keep exploring other areas of your life where you’ve had anxiety and use what you’ve learned to stop worrying. for me, this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding, and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. the more of these long-standing anxieties you’re able to ease, the better you’ll feel overall. plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would’ve never been able to do. there really isn’t much left to say at this stage. i found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because i knew i was so close to the finish line but not quite there. in case you need any encouragement, remind yourself of how well you’ve done so far and that there’s more to come. then finally… no anxiety, with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1: that’s it. all the voices in your head telling you you’re not good enough have gone silent. all those symptoms you used to worry so much about don’t really happen anymore. you might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days, but most of the time you’re energetic, present, and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you’ve never had. it’s been a few months since you’ve even given your anxiety a second thought. you know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while, but you’re not worried about them. you know exactly what to do when that happens, and that they’ll go away just as quickly as they came. i don’t have any advice for this point. you know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you’ll keep on doing it. congratulations. you understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. remember this feeling. _ my therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb i think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do, do the opposite. if it’s telling you not to get out of bed, do it. if it’s telling you not to go to a social event, do that. if it’s telling you you’re going to suffer from some grave illness, remind yourself that’s not true. if it’s telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help, don’t. if it’s telling you you’re losing your mind, remind yourself you’re not. give it enough time, and eventually things will get better. **summary:** **ease into your symptoms. remember that it’s just anxiety and can’t do anything other than make you uncomfortable. you’ve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.** **don’t fight it. when you fight your anxiety, it only gets worse. so let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.** **keep yourself occupied. the more time you spend thinking about your anxiety, googling your symptoms, posting on this subreddit, writing in your journal, or just stewing in general, the worse off you’ll be. cook, clean, dance, exercise, paint, draw, do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.** **keep pushing the bounds of what you’re doing. expose yourself to more anxiety. exercise harder. try things you’ve never tried before. make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it’ll only benefit you in the end.** **regularly question your thoughts. just because you think something doesn’t make it true. you’ll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you’ve been dreading isn’t half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.** **give it time. you’ll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.** thank you for reading this. i really hope that, no matter where you’re at in life, you gained something from this. please let me know what parts of this were the most helpful, or if there’s anything you

realize what a **huge** difference your efforts can make. good luck guys :)",Anxiety
"making friends is something i'm legitimately unable to wrap my head around. even as my social anxiety has lessened, i *cannot* understand how people do it. the only way i've managed to make friends is having people approach me first, and had they not, i would be completely alone. i feel as though i have some developmental disorder because of how socially impaired i am. going up to someone i don't know and talking to them seems impossible to me, unless it's somewhere like a store or restaurant (which i still struggle with from time to time). not knowing how they'll react scares me, and i feel like any attempt i made at conversation with anyone would result in me embarrassing myself and nothing else.",Anxiety
"when i was about 12 (25 years ago), i used to have this group of friends that i would go out to lunch with to restaurants near school on half days. one day at school, i overheard this one guy who was in the same group ask another guy in the group if i was going to lunch that day. the other guy said no, and the first guy said ""good, because raingodofmorning is so annoying."" then he turned around and saw me, and gave some half-hearted, awkward, non-apology. i've never really gotten over this, and i have a fear of hanging out with people and them secretly wishing i wasn't there because i'm so annoying, but me never knowing about it. and i actually think that i might be pretty annoying to be around. my brain works really, really fast and i have anxiety and adhd, so i talk fast and i can talk a lot. i put a ton of effort into not interrupting, but it's very hard to listen without getting distracted by random thoughts. (i know that everyone does this, and try to remind myself most people aren't paying attention to everything i say, but i feel like an extreme case of this). i have trouble in awkward silences with coworkers not filling the silence, like i never know when to leave someone's office or how to stop talking when someone is in my office--even if i want the person to leave. i don't talk to anyone outside of work except for some out of town friends via text (i type too much there, too). i had some friends i used to hang out with at these gatherings where they'd host people at their house weekly, and i stopped hanging out with them suddenly. i saw them recently when they came by to pick up something from me, and it was a pretty awkward encounter, and they didn't say anything like ""we miss you at the gatherings"" or ""why don't you come anymore?,"" or ""you should come next week,"" or anything, really, outside of a vague ""we should get dinner sometime"" that sounded like the clichéd thing people say when parting, regardless of whether they mean it. this is something i've identified as an external clue (as in, not something from my own head) that they might also find me annoying. i'm not quite sure if i should work on: (a) just accepting that i am an annoying person and being okay with keeping my contact with others limited in order to avoid inadvertently thrusting myself upon a social group one too many times, or (b) if i should work on convincing myself that i'm not annoying, even if it isn't really true.

"you know how there is often this sense of fear at the back of your mind? that no matter how well things are going, there is a small voice that says: ""watch out, bad things are happening! never let your guard down!"" that voice is what kept our ancestors alive. our brains have a preprogrammed tendency to pay attention to the negative, to danger and trouble, and that is in part what fuels our anxiety. the good news is that underneath our experience there is also an underlying sense of ok-ness, alrightness. while you may be stressed out or upset, there is a foundation of awareness that runs deeper than any temporary fear, like a quiet sea bed hundred feet below a howling storm. in fact, take a close look at this moment, right now. you are probably alright: no one is attacking you, you are not falling or drowning, there is no immediate crisis. your experience might be far from perfect, and it might include unpleasant thoughts or emotions, but right this moment at least, you are basically okay. there are of course times when you are not okay. sometimes you are in real danger, your body is hurting, someone is mistreating you or your mind is in full panic mode. but i bet that during any given day, you can find a half a dozen or a dozen moments where you can honestly say, ""yeah, right now i'm okay"". notice and savor those experiences! you are not trying to convince yourself of anything or trying to cover of your suffering under a thin varnish of ""positive thinking"". you are simply becoming aware of the fact that you are not under threat, in danger or harmed. experiencing this over time, again and again, will gradually change your brain an help you become calmer and stronger. *adapted from rick hanson's just one thing.*",Anxiety

"my wife passed out from a panic attack yesterday in the theatre while we were watching *a quiet place*. i was so scared and didn't know what to do. about an hour into the movie, there's a scene where someone steps on a nail. it wasn't even very gory, but i guess it triggered some bad memories for her. a few seconds after that scene, my wife's arm started twitching kind of like a seizure. at the same time, she started making sounds like she was snoring or maybe choking. when i looked at her, her head was lolled to the side and her eyes were closed. not realizing what was happening, i nudged her a bit, thinking she had fallen asleep. when her head rolled to the other side and there wasn't any other response my concern sky-rocketed. i took her head in my hands and gently shook her a little bit trying to wake her up. her eyes partially opened, and i could see her pupils were looking up like when you roll your eyes. there was no other response. i tilted her head forward and the ""snoring"" sound stopped, but she was still unconscious. at this point, about half a minute or so had passed with her in this state and i thought i had a real medical emergency on my hands. there were only two other people in the theatre with us, and they were a couple rows ahead of us. they glanced back when i started to loudly say, *""are you okay?! honey, are you all right?""* i was about to call 911. with her head in my hands, i placed my mouth against her ear and yelled, *""can you hear me?! honey!?!""* suddenly, there was signs cognition. her eyes opened, and she started breathing very quickly. i'd estimate she was out for about a minute. she glanced around like she was trying to figure out where she was at, and finally seemed to see and recognize me. in between gasps for breath she managed to say, *""i'm having a panic attack.""* up to that point i didn't know what was going on. i was so scared. *""come on, let's go.""* i said. i put my arm under hers and held her tightly as we descended the stairs. she wasn't steady on her feet, and was leaning on me quite a bit. when we finally got out of the theatre she collapsed down on the floor against the wall and kind of rocked a little bit back and forth. *""i... can't... take... visceral horror.""* she said. i just held her; trying to comfort her. after a couple minutes she said she felt well enough to walk, so we walked back to our car. she said she didn't need to go to the hospital. we only live about 5 minutes from the theatre. after we made it home, she said she just needed me to hold her and help her feel safe. i tried to just hold her and comfort her. after about a half hour she was doing better. i felt so helpless when she was unconscious. it's very scary when you suddenly realize your loved one is having a medical emergency. later in the evening, she revealed to me that when she was a teenager, she had an abusive boyfriend that would rape her, cut her with a scalpel, and poke her with needles. sick stuff like that i guess. she wouldn't say much more about it than that. i am angry. not at her, but at the thought some sicko did this to her. and i hurt. i grieve that she has experienced something so traumatic it causes this type of thing. she agreed we will get her into some therapy. she needs healing that i never knew she needed. i also know this isn't about me, but i feel a bit hurt this is just now coming out. we've been married about 5 years, and i never knew this stuff. what else don't i know? i don't know what type of advice i'm looking for. how can i be there for her? how can i help? what do i do if this happens again? did i do the right thing both during and after?",Anxiety

"i have what i would call mild social anxiety. basically i'm shy but it really doesn't bother me much. what bothers me is my lack of success with girls. even thinking about it makes me anxious. thinking about the last girl i liked (who is now in a relationship) basically puts me into a panic attack, heart racing, hot face, almost in tears, can't do anything. seeing couples or hearing about them also makes me very anxious. going on things like tinder or facebook to try and get girls makes me really anxious as well. the problem is that this anxiety is so overwhelming that i don't even go on facebook or tinder anymore. it literally ruins my day if i do. but the more i don't socialise the worse this anxiety gets. i feel like i'm in an ever increasing hole. i'm 23 and never had a girlfriend so this might explain why i'm like this. but i don't know what to do to alleviate this. i don't tell anyone about it as it's so pathetic. i don't have a hard life and have no justification to feel this way, but i do. after going on facebook this morning i've been feeling terrible all day. i don't even know why i'm posting this, i just don't know where to go from here.",Anxiety

(this was one of my co-workers) but when i struggled with low mood i was told ‘we all have days like that’ ... ‘don’t let customers see you unhappy or uncomfortable’ this is an issue with how subjective everyday anxiety and a chronic mental health issue is, if someone does not understand the effort it takes to behave normally they will default to judging you based on how they deal with it. of course it’s not all bad, i’m lucky to have family and a handful of friends that have seen me go though treatments and recovery so know the full spectrum of my issues and do not judge or baby me. i felt like sharing this little rant to hear your thoughts on if you’ve been accepted or told to ‘hide’ symptoms from the public to spare their discomfort... like your doing it on purpose.",Anxiety

"i just got my results back from my covid swabs.. and they were negative. now let’s go back a week, i couldn’t breathe , i couldn’t take deep breaths and i was coughing. i figured it’s just a cold.. back to my phone. things got worse. i got chills and aches and my breathing was getting more difficult. hmm maybe the flu? back to my phone. still couldn’t breathe , now sweating and coughing harder. hearts racing and on the floor scared and crying because breathing becoming impossible. i went and had a hot bath, drank hot tea , then went to bed .. where i had the worst night of my life . i couldn’t sleep... i was up for 72 hours exhausted in cold sweats with breathing troubles . i finally called the nurses line and told them i was afraid i had coronavirus. we talked and they said to get to the hospital if i got worse , but to phone beforehand so they could prepare for me. my heart sunk and my symptoms got worse. i cried as my kids slept, positive this was the end... i didn’t want to kiss them and infect them, i kept leaving the room and taking deep breaths so i wouldn’t drop dead. i texted my family that i loved them and was sorry for everything i had ever done. i finally passed out , then woke up and immediately ran to the bathroom where i threw up . i hadn’t eaten in 2 days and still puked my guts out. chest still hurt, still having cold sweats and still coughing .. and now nauseated with a bad stomach. maybe i won’t even make it to the hospital. i watched a cnn video of one of their reporters who was sick with covid. he showed some breathing exercises and said to put your arms around your head and to hold it there . i kept doing that over and over and felt better each time. didn’t feel like i was dying as bad as a few nights before . however each time i read the news my symptoms got worse and my panicking was like nothing i’ve experienced before .. i took some medicine and i cried myself to sleep. i finally slept.. briefly . i then woke up and had a bunch of mucus come up my throat and i began choking on it .. it wouldn’t stop coming up and my chest pains started up. they called me and my covid test was scheduled for the next day. i took some mucus cold medicine which seemed to help as i slept for the first time since this hell started.. and i woke up feeling good. no coughing .. no cold sweats... no puking. chest was still tight but i slept and that’s just what i needed. my test was at 1 and i was nervous , i pulled up and everyone was covered and masked up and i felt so alone. they asked about my symptoms as well as if i had depression or anxiety... both of which i do. they checked my temperature, my blood pressure, my throat and swabbed my throat and both nostrils. i said i didn’t sleep much and i was spending about 13 hours a day on the news.. mainly watching new york city and italy. the doctor stopped by and said do not.. watch any news outside of where you live (our province) she said “watch/read only your province news as everything else will only make your anxiety worse than ever.. just focus on keeping yourself and everyone around you safe. keep washing your hands frequently and stay indoors and away from others.. and that includes your grandma” she is my grandmas doctor and knows how close we were. i went home and cleaned and for the first time .. stayed off international news. that was a few days ago and i have yet to go back on any... and i haven’t had a single anxiety attack since. all my symptoms besides chest pain went away... when i start to think about it again (like right now) they come back a bit .. so i’ll turn a movie on and they go away. so when i got my results i just thought wow anxiety is one of the scariest things... i truly thought i was going to die. i know there’s a lot of scary horrible things going around our world right now , and i hope it is over soon, but watching the news 24/7 isn’t going to help anything especially if you are mentally ill like me. the best thing we can do, is stay busy and stay safe and stay off the international news . i just wanted to post this incase anyone was like me browsing here wondering if you have anxiety or if it’s covid... anxiety is a true evil and will make you think you have whatever it is you’re scared of. deep breaths and put your focus elsewhere.. like a meditation app. thinking of you all. sorry i typed this on my iphone and have no clue how to format properly.",Anxiety

"couldn't think how to title this. i've got other issues but i'm thinking this one may be tied to my anxiety/panic problems (or maybe it just exacerbates them?) for example, i've noticed it most pointedly the past week while my cat's been sick. she's been to the doctor, i'm handling the practical stuff. but emotionally it's roller coaster. she seems to be feeling better (responding to meds and eating) and my mind's saying yeah, she's back. she seems a lil stiff and not eating as much as the previous days and my mind starts planning her funeral. (rationally i can see she's not acting like a sick cat, you can tell when they're uncomfortable and have given up. plus the vet hasn't done or said anything that seems like they think she's that sick. it's just my scared little mind that won't shut up and stop crying) it's like anything (in general, not just currently with the cat), but any time something isn't perfect, it's the end of the world and i'm positive it'll never get better. so i seem to spend a lot of time worrying about how i'm gonna handle the worst-case scenario which my mind won't stop telling me is definite even though the rational whisper knows i've never yet had to deal with the worst-case scenarios. i'm just wondering if y'all can relate? is this an anxiety/panic related thing? i've got some other issues (diagnosed bipolar and self-suspected mild asperger's) so i'm trying to define/understand what's going on with this catastrophe thinking because i deal with my issues/symptoms best when i understand better where they stem from.",Anxiety
"whenever i'm awake for too long, i get anxiety, even though i have nothing to feel anxious about. like,if i need to stay awake for studying or work in, or, for example,let's say i stayed up all night, and then i want to stay awake during the day to fix my internal clock; (so i won't sleep during the day and stay awake during night again) i get strong anxiety and then i end up needing to sleep before planned. when i force myself to go through it, i end up feeling incredibly unwell (nauseous, low pressure, tachycardia) once or twice before i start having full-on panic attacks. then the crisis keeps going and i have to wait until they pause so i, again against my plans, can go to sleep. it seems there's no way out. i hate this and i wish i could push my body when needed like a normal person. this always happens when i push myself to stay awake and is really annoying, and also, other people don't understand or trust me and end up seeing me as just undisciplined and unable to have self control (just sleeping because i give in too easily or idk). tl;dr: post title",Anxiety
"my doctor and counselor have me listed as extreme anxiety and depression, early childhood ptsd, bi polar, borderline personality disorder. it's a relief to have an answer to what my problems are. this has been an on going problem my whole adult life. my first job, i had reasons for being depressed. i dropped out of school, parents were divorcing and i didn't have a stable housing situation, i was falling behind and depressed, full of anger and anxiety. i didn't want to call myself weak though and admit i had a problem, so i attempted to self medicate by escaping reality. i skateboarded, played video games, drank, smoked weed, partied, did everything i could to feel numb. 5 years later, because i didn't seek help or medication early on, i was put on suicide watch due to my new medications not working properly. i have had a girlfriend for 4 years now, i just play games now and skate, no negative influences in my life. none the less, last month i lost my job, where both my girlfriend and i worked together, and commuted together for 2 hours everyday. we both made pretty decent incomes, my girlfriend is my back bone and structure to things getting better in my life. i can't thank her enough despite me losing my job and making the workplace awkward for her. she helped me apply for disability. she helped me stay in contact with my advocate for whatever questions needed to be answered. we filled out the questionnaire's together and made the best of a shitty situation, we have savings to go off of, luckily we live with her father in a nice location in california rent free, we cover utilities and our phone bill/internet and that's it. well, has and groceries as well, we just do our best on her one income until my sdi gets submitted and approved. i'm currently seeking my residency and gathering needed paperwork for the drivers written test, then i can finish my sdi application. my point to all this is i would be homeless and probably dead without her. she has saved my ass countless times over the years,having a mental illness makes holding a job so uselessing difficult, i've lost at least 6 jobs since being with her. i have nothing but respect and love for her to be putting up with all this, while we are both still fairly young (i'm 24, she's 21 later this year) i wish her parents understood mental illness, but it's kind of a taboo in her family so we keep things as vague as possible. i just hope that i get through to disability services and can make an income that way, to relieve some stress from her life. she put off school for me from the very beginning, the least i can do is help her get through school. sorry about the rant. i hope everyone has a great day.",Anxiety

"tomorrow i bury my best friend who tragically passed away at the age of 25. i'm heartbroken and i will be speaking at his funeral. i am happy with the speech but i am nervous, petrified to mess up. he was an incredible guy and i want to send him off well, justify what he meant to me. my ex who broke up with me 2 months ago has kept contact to ask how i have been doing and if i ever needed anything go to her. i went to the gym yesterday evening just to pass the time and maybe work off a small hangover i was nursing from the night before. i felt okay but by the end of my session i was very tired. as i was walking back towards my flat i spot my ex with a guy next to her sitting down. i could have turned around but i didn't. i go up to her and say hi, she seems shocked to see me and asks if i'm doing okay. i say no, not really and say i'll leave them to it and say goodbye. as i walk down the road my ex has caught up with me after she runs to catch up with me. she says she has done this to tell me that what's happening with her and him is not what it seems and she didn't want me to worry about something when it's not. she says they are not seeing each other and that he is just a work friend. that he is going through a hard time. we then get talking about how i'm feeling, how devestated i am, how i'm scared for wednesday. she and a mutual friend went to a concert last week and she mentions they talked. she said she went on a rant about how much she cares about me, that i was her best friend, that she is worried for me. she says she's nearly messaged me just to see if i want to hang out. she has come to me since my best friends death to apologise and she says that she will leave me alone now and will wait for me to message. i do say i miss her but right now my head is all over the place. i'm considering my options about going home and starting again. that i'm not looking for anyone right now. i'm just tired, exhausted. she said i look like i haven't eaten well, that i'm really pale. she nearly went to the same club as me the night before but didn't and stays she's glad she didn't. she offers to cook me a meal or go for coffee. that she is always here for me. i ask again about them and she says they're not seeing other, that something could happen but it isn't. i accidentally saw her open diary just before the break up about a guy who has a family that makes her laugh, feel alive. this guy has a child. i recognise him from her xmas party. i'm really confused about why she chased after me. it's obvious she cares but is she feeling guilty, trying to spare my feelings in the hardest time of my life. i do want her back in my life but seeing her with another guy hurt big time. seeing them close to each other eating ice cream. she works with him, did she like him when we were dating. i also hate the idea of her sharing her sympathy and support with other people, especially a guy like that. and it hurts to hear her say to me he's going through a hard time. i'm going through the hardest time of my life. i feel like i can't use her as a crutch. i'm so confused, hurt, a mess. i bury my best friend tomorrow . i am absolutely terrified. i feel sick, like i'm going to mess up and ruin everything. the last 2 months has been the worst of my life, it just has. i want things to be better. i want him back. i want her back. i feel terrible.",Anxiety

"i might not be able to help everyone but hopefully one person. i'm in no way an expert and i'm still trying to master the following method. it's all about mindfulness/awareness/living in the moment, that's the answer. why do we get anxious at times? because of our thoughts - thoughts that only exists in our mind. it's almost impossible to be anxious while you're living in the moment without thinking about the past or the future. each time you catch yourself thinking/daydreaming just be aware of it and go back to the present and you'll see what a huge difference this makes. i'm not keeping my mind busy to forget about things, i'm doing my best to keep my mind quiet. at night before i go to sleep, i focus on nothing and i have been sleeping a lot better and i am no longer dealing with morning anxiety, why? because i am not focusing on any thought, i'm letting thoughts come and go. this is seriously as easy as it sounds, try it. for a few hours just let thoughts come and go and just be ""aware"" of that precise moment. before when i used to practice this i always gave up because i thought i was supposed to not think of anything but the key is to just be aware that you're thinking, control the thoughts, don't allow them to control you.",Anxiety

"i’ve had various forms of anxiety for years, but it’s my anxiety surrounding work that’s giving me the hardest time. i currently work from home as a freelancer (not by choice), and it’s getting harder and harder to keep things in perspective. i get irrationally worried that i’ve made a mistake, and when i do make the inevitable mistake, it feels as if my entire world is falling apart. like i’ve failed in the one thing i still have in my life, and am therefore undeserving of life. outwardly, i can accept criticism gracefully, but on the inside i’m a screaming disaster. i can deal with those feelings. it’s awful and makes me want to vomit until i die, but i’ve somehow managed for years. what’s giving me problems now is what i call “hiding.” i’ve become so afraid of these feelings that i’ve started avoiding working by default. i don’t open emails that have the slightest possibility of criticism. i put off sending emails that might lead to more work. i’ve started avoiding social media because i might see criticism of my work (even though that has literally never happened, and rationally i know it won’t). and with no boss or co-workers to check in on me, i don’t have any impetus to snap out of it. this self-isolation is bad for my mental health (i live alone and have little enough interaction with other humans as it is), and it’s incredibly damaging to my work life. i need advice on how to stop. i’m planning on seeing a therapist as soon as i can afford it—but if i can’t snap out of it first, i won’t ever be able to afford it. has anybody else experienced this? what did/do you do to help?",Anxiety

"around 4 years ago, i went through the worst anxiety i have ever been through. i didn't understand what was wrong with me and thought i was dying. i couldn't be left alone or go outside without going through a panic attack. i would convince myself that every lump i felt was cancerous and make numerous visits to the hospital only for them to send me home after hours of waiting. i was prescribed diazepam/beta blockers and almost prescribed citalopram but i only choose to take 2 diazepam and that was it. during this time i told my mum that i wanted to be sectioned because i believed that i wasn't in control of myself and was unaware that it was my anxiety causing me to think this way. every appointment i attended was also through the help of my mum as i felt like i couldn't go to any of them alone. i received two visits by mental-health specialists, 1 of them believed i should be on medication for life and that i would need to take medication to function and do normal things. the other told me that i should prove him wrong. as time went on i began counselling and attended a group cbt class. at first i felt like nothing had changed and that i had wasted my time but looking back on it now, i feel like everything got put into perspective around that time when i realised that my anxiety is just a part of me and that no matter what discomfort i go through it always ends up going away, i chose to feel the anxiety and not let it affect me doing anything i wanted to do. within the past 2 and a half years i have attended job interviews, bank/doctor appointments and completed a mathematics course. i now do my own food shopping, have a part-time job which is a customer-facing role and i'm in the process of working with a job agency to get a better job. to cut a long story short, i have went from having severe agoraphobia and panic attacks (-4 years ago) to working a part-time job and doing everything for myself. i'll probably delete this post in few hours but i hope it helps somebody on here who feels like their life will never change. i'm also open to any questions, if there are any.",Anxiety
"okay so let me expand a bit on what i'm meaning. basically i go through stages, where i am gripped by my anxiety, where i feel like i need to embody how other people are. by that, i mean i feel like i need to keep changing who i am in order for people to like me. for example, i recently watched a short video on fb taken from a british reality tv show. in it this girl didn't drink alcohol due to personal reasons, so this lead me down a mini anxiety trip of feeling like if i didn't drink people would think i was different and like me. i know this sounds absolutely absurd and it's so wrong to be thinking like that, but i have this constant need to be liked by everyone &amp; i'm also worried that i'll never find who i really am as a person. this then leads me down a whole other path of anxiety riddled thoughts and i end up putting myself in such a hole that i become so unproductive and i hate myself for it. i'm so tired, i want to achieve something in life but i'm literally doing nothing with my life and when i see other people doing stuff, it's like, i should be more like them. i should be motivated and i should be who they are so people like me and make people proud of me. sorry for this vent, i feel like i've gone off on a bit of a tangent at the end there, but i have no one to talk to about these feelings &amp; i wanted to know if it's a common thing or not.",Anxiety

"hey everyone, since quitting weed 1.5 years ago due to the worst (and first) panic attack of my life, i have been experiencing extreme anxiety and panic attacks. i experienced the weirdest and most horrible symptoms including convulsions, nausea, butterflies in stomach, thoughts of death, ectopic heart beats, rolling panic attacks lasting hours/days, itchy skin, pain during urination, sever depression, feeling like i can’t breathe, feeling like i am going to die, insomnia, depersonalisation, derealisation, pains in chest, neck, head, weakness in legs, crazy head pressure where the only way i could sleep was on my stomach because i couldn’t relax my head on my pillow, and face rash, among others. it slowly started getting better last year and then one day it got way worse, and kept getting worse. so then i went to a doctor and got a full checkup because i thought i was dying (anxiety). everything came back normal (except the ectopic heart beats (but they are not dangerous) so then i asked for a referral to see a psych (after she offered me drugs and i said no). started seeing my psych over the course of the last 3 months and over that time i slowly got better until today i realised i have been anxiety free for the last 6 weeks. i also read this book which helped a lot, it’s called rewiring your anxious brain. these two things along with changing jobs from one i hated to one i love has in my opinion cured my anxiety. i am turning 27 this year and the last 1.5 years of my life were the absolute worst years of my life. i am finally loving life again and am so happy that the panic attacks have disappeared and that i am not constantly thinking i am dying. hope this helps anyone who is in a similar situation that i was.",Anxiety

"while the titles is pretty self explanatory, i’ll elaborate a little bit. my anxiety has gotten so bad that any time i go to add something to a conversation (whether irl or online) my brain just immediately starts telling me that what i have to say doesn’t matter. it could literally be me commenting something extremely positive or congratulating someone on an accomplishment that i’m sure the receiver would be thankful to hear, but my brain instantly convinces myself that what i have to say adds zero value to the conversation and that nobody cares about my opinion. i know realistically not everybody is going to care about what i have to say, which is completely okay, but i’m try to convince my brain that there are people who do value my opinions and what i have to add to the conversation. but it’s at the point that it’s starting to effect my personal and professional development in life and it’s just this massive hurdle that i can’t seem to get over. has anybody else experienced this?",Anxiety

"it's always been something i have feared but it's got so much worse since developing anxiety. i think it stems down to the fact i had a tooth removed when i was only 5. doesn't sound like a big deal but my mum didn't tell me i had to have it removed till the actual day. she just woke me up and got me in the car and told me we were going to the hospital (the children's dentist was at the hospital) so they could put me asleep and remove my tooth. obviously at 5 that seemed pretty scary, didn't help that i had to wait 3 hours when i got there. then again at 7 i had another tooth taken out and it hurt so much i couldn't eat but when i got back to school the teacher forced me too. so now i hate the dentist i have this fear they will end up pulling all my teeth out, which i know is stupid but i can't help it. i'm 17 and havnt been since i was about 9, i desperately need to go because depression and anxiety resulted in me not brushing my teeth often enough and now they look terrible and i also need and would like braces. my main worry is one tooth which has a hole in it and the hole is turning black (tooth decay i'm guessing) i terrified they will just pull it out. anxiety is really making all my fears worse and not to mention the thought of going into the office and lying down while someone prods around in my mouth, i have severe social anxiety so many situations like dentist and doctors appointments make me nervous enough as it is. i don't know what to do i'm going to ask my mum to book an appointment but i won't be able to stop panicking till it's all sorted.",Anxiety

"i wrote a reply to someone elsewhere about my anxiety -- and it made me think about finally speaking about it more publicly. perhaps some people can benefit from my long, embarrassing, terrifying journey. the pictures in this post merely represent improvement over time, although the video would help a lot more, i am not sure if i should publish them or not, at least yet. my journey with anxiety still continues after five years, but at varying points i have had improvements. i lost a job as a result of anxiety, and gradually anxiety took over my life, ending up pure agoraphobic. i did not leave my house for 3 months, and then a few months later i agreed to take fluoxetine (prozac). i started at a mere 1mg because i believed that the medication would make me worse, and result in my death. gradually i rose it over a few weeks until i [finally took my first full to be honest, it gave me headaches but i did sometimes get a feeling of different peace. but then i would often feel quite hyperactive. i started walking to places again, but was probably still using a lot of alcohol at the time. at certain times i would also use propranolol but was convinced it would also kill me. one day i managed to have dental work done, but they gave me 2 diazepam (10mg). the feeling from those finally gave me a feeling of freedom for the first time. i was no longer inside the zone of anxiety. a couple of months past by, and i started acquiring it. eventually i was taking about 10-15mg/day, and the doctors wanted me off it, so i decided to taper. eventually i was off that and onto pregabalin, as it helped the side effects. pregabalin definitely helped me and was the first medication i liked besides the previous diazepam. i have also taken citalopram and hated it, and flipped out and went on an 8 hour bike ride hoping it would come out of my system. although i have had similar thoughts before. sometimes i would freak out and think maybe if i slit my wrists i could bleed out a chemical or something. i guess that is why i was eventually put on something called early intervention for psychosis. **i didn't leave my town for 4 years.** i used a lot of alcohol. i had incidents were i passed out and the usual stuff, and i believed that ultimately, i was going to die. i had nightmares daily about dying in plane crashes. there mere noise of a bus began to eat away at me. i believed that death would be an option, however i never truly acted upon it with intention. i decided to take sertraline at the recommendation of multiple doctors, and all i can say with regards to that is it did help me a bit. gradually i started walking further. but to be honest, i have become very apathetic on it and feel it is time to stop. not to mention it gives me slight diarrhea sometimes. no headaches though. interestingly once i started sertraline, i started therapy, and had a worker within the nhs that drove me to see the sea. [for the first time in 5 years i could hear the -- it was an incredibly experience as quite honestly i believed i should have been dead. i was on 100mg/day, i'm now on roughly 12.5mg. [i caught a bus for the first time and went ...maybe 1/4 of a but that was a success also. i'm a bit more stable these days, however i have relapsed on benzos. at the end of the day benzos are *uselessing effective*. they are the gold standard for anxiety. the problem i have right now is i probably should taper but tbh i do not see the point right now -- as i am presently on sertraline still, including ~30-40mg propranolol, ~400mg pregabalin and 10-30mg diazepam. i eventually overcame my fear of propranolol and it actually proved fairly useful. infact in some cases it is more useful than a benzo... sort of. today i am slightly more stable imo, and propranolol and diazepam and pregabalin maintain stability for now. i'd like to try and just decrease all of the drugs in my system. although some people take way more than me :) recently i finally had the courage to travel in a car to other places.

"i first called my future boss today, (anxiety for calling him). we decided we was gonna drive to the office in the city and talk (the city is 20min away), so i asked my grandma to drive me there. that’s anxiety number 2, being seen with my grandma. i then decided i was gonna go to a store in the city and buy some stuff. this is anxiety trigger number 3. go where it’s a lot of ppl. we went to the office first. he said i can start next week! i even meet my little brothers friends big brother there, cause he was buying something there. the boss even showed me the workspace and his partners and i said hi and talked like i don’t have anxiety / social anxiety at all. i didn’t think “omg what do they think of me etc” nothing like that happened! then we went to the store to buy cloths and some stuff, i went there i talked like normal, i answered hi when the ppl that work there said hi. i looked at them even! then we couldn’t find my cloths really, so we asked a guy that work there. he said follow me and i went away from my grandma cause she went the other way! so now i’m alone with a stranger! i talked to him like normal, i got what i wanted then i said “thank you!” then i calmly walked back to my grandma! then i was gonna try my new bank card. i never used that in a store before and i had huge anxiety that it won’t work when a lot of ppl watching me. so we go to the thingy where u pay, i lay everything up and it didn’t work the first time cause i didn’t push the card all the way in. i even said “hm it doesn’t work” then he said what to do. i did it and i payed then i stood still like so calmly and un anxious while i was looking at my grandma paying when it was like 10 other ppl in the line. it wasn’t a lot of ppl in that store it was no sounds really cause it was only a few ppl there, so maybe i woulda got a lot more anxious if it was more sound/ more ppl but wow i just did this! dijgkwofjskfkdjfjd im so proud of myself! like how on earth did i not feel any anxiety, when normally my anxiety/ social anxiety is god awful! is it cause it’s summer or what?! i just had to share this to someone!!! happy boy. (i’m 20) so a lot of ppl probably expect me to do this without my grandma there in the first place but, i did it!! i didn’t even feel the need to be with my grandma there, like i felt quite confident even if she wouldn’t be there. i did it!",Anxiety

"i don't see it being discussed much. it makes me feel rather isolated. i don't think i even remember joy. i only seem to recall fear and deep sadness. i've been depressed since i was 9. i suppose i was genetically predisposed to it as it runs on both sides of the family. a lengthy move across the pond, and the bullying that went with being the new, weird kid at school triggered it. an inferiority complex due to a learning disability only made it spiral uncontrollably. most people my age (i'm turning 18 next month) seem to be so excited about life, but i only feel helpless. i am exhausted at this point in life, and feel like i can barely keep up with the ever so busy and growing world. depression has taken all interests and motivation away from me. i have a rather vapid life with a personality to match. i'd be open to read your experiences and feelings!",Depression

"i deliver pizza. sometimes people will put silly things in the delivery instructions. a lot of 16-22 girls will casually sexually objectify us by putting things like, ""send the cutest boy!"" or something like that. i don't like it, but whatever. the drawbacks of living in a patriarchy is that teen girls can be gross leches and get away with it, i just try and do my job. we don't get to pick what orders we take. so i got stuck with one that said ""send your cutest boy"". i do not have very good self esteem. i once weighed close to 300 pounds, but through diet and a lot of exercise i've been able to get down to 230. i was sexually abused when i was 5 years old and have ptsd from it. i've spent my life feeling beyond ugly. sick and just repellent. when i made the delivery, the girl made a face at me. like not just a ""oh darn. a guy who looks about 29 and isn't a star athelete (like some of the guys i work with)."" it was a full on, ""ugh"" face. she tipped me and i gave her good service and was very polite despite feeling very offended to be judged when i'm just trying to do my job and didn't ask for this. later that night i find out she actually put ""i ordered the cutest delivery boy and didn't get it"" as a complaint in our feedback form which can both be seen by literally everyone i work with as well as our corporate office. so my entire store knows i was called ugly. and because of my self esteem issues...despite knowing this girl is a sexist asshole, i have felt like i'm about as attractive as a puss filled tumor all night. i could call this person up and let her know what her cruelty did to me. i could write all this up in a note and leave it at her door, but all it would do is make me look crazy because a 17 year old with bad skin and a terrible dress sense called me ugly and made me feel 2 inches tall after trying to sexually objectify me when i'm just trying to do my damn job. thank you for reading. you're a nice person and i love you.",Depression

""you'll get through it"". but i'm 29. when does it just get better? when does all of my hard work and effort turn into happiness? i feel like even the counselors i've been to don't want to hear my complaining. they just tell me to breath more when i feel anxious. like, useless you! what do you think i'm doing! i go to yoga regularly and i'm still uselessing anxious. i go jogging. i do weight lifting. i go for walks. i read. and i'm still do sad. but then again, maybe it's just me. maybe i'm just doing this all wrong. i should be able to figure out how to make myself better. i should be able to stop myself from being sad all the time. but no one wants to help me. no one wants to listen to me complain. i can see it in there eyes when i start to talk about my struggles. they can barely wait for me to change the subject. tl;dr how do you know if your depressed or if you just suck at life? i try so hard to make myself better but maybe in the end i'm just lazy and self-absorbed and that's why in unhappy. update: thank you all for your replies and kind words. i'm amazed this post got so many comments and likes. and even though i don't know you guys, it has made me feel really supported on these really bad days. i saw a new psychologist today who diagnosed me with with an adjustment disorder, coupled with anxiety and depression. she referred me to a prescriber, but i have to wait a couple weeks for an appointment. hopefully i can get some meds then. even though i don't feel any better, it's a little comforting to have a diagnosis. and even more comforting to know this community exists. thank you so much.",Depression

"so there we were arguing who uselessed up the relationship, she'd never agree that it was her fault. i'd always apologize even if i was wrong. i refused to apologize and it all uselessed up. she knew i had depression when we were in relationship. i told her i feel depressed and she said ""there's no such thing as depression"" anyway, she found out from out our common friend that i visited my doctor to get help and will begin medication soon. so at the end of the chat,i told her i'm not okay and she is making me feel even more bad, she should just leave me alone, so she dropped the bomb and said ""i don't give a useless even if you die"" i stopped texting her after that. i was already having suicidal thoughts, but since now she wants me to die, i uselessing won't. useless you.. i'll outlive you , you stupid piece of shit. edit: just came home and saw your replies. i'm overwhelmed seeing your responses. in the process of opening up and sharing my experience with you, even if i can help one person, i'd be the happiest person in this world.",Depression

"when other people see me, they see a beige mass of carbon named robert. they see brown eyes, blackish hair and if they’re observant, a mole on my nose. they see a son, a brother, a stranger, a student, a friend. sometimes i’d even agree with them. then there’s the version of me that only i can see. when i look in the mirror, i see a liar, a faker, and a freak. i see an overly sensitive, repulsive little goblin with more misery in his heart than he knows what to do with. usually, my emotions are overshadowed by a deep feeling of worthlessness. when it’s really bad, i feel nothing at all. imagine you’re lying down on your bed. now imagine you have one hundred kilograms on your chest, no-let’s make that two hundred kilograms. with all the added weight it can be hard to move, but if you’re really strong you can still do it. now let’s add shackles, you are now bound to your bed by a metal chain. with all the weight on your chest, you barely have the breath to yell for help but you still manage to do it. but that’s not enough, the shadow that consumes you doesn’t want any company. now imagine being sedated. although the sedative makes you sleepy it doesn’t put you to sleep. all it does is makes you incoherent so you're unable to cry for help. this is what it feels like on a good day. on a typical day, you get everything i mentioned above plus the voices. the voices sound like nails being dragged across a chalkboard while a cat is getting crushed inside a blender. they tell you that you are a worthless, miserable, unlovable waste of a human being that probably would have been better off had you never been born at all. they remind you that life is pointless, painful, and absurd. you begin to think that you’re probably better off dead. on the really bad days you listen to these thoughts. all the while, you are completely unable to communicate these feelings to anyone you care about. you begin to think a veil has been lifted and you now see the world for how it really is. in reality, you are now seeing the world with a different set of eyes, through the veil of depression. you are absolutely terrified of being exposed. you fear people will see you as weak and vulnerable, you fear finding out that people don’t care, but more than anything you fear the stigma, and that’s what stops you from getting help. so you go it alone and face these feelings entirely by yourself.",Depression
"that’s the best i can explain how i feel, i guess. it’s odd, but the only thing i’ve felt for a while now, so is strangely comforting due to its consistency. i feel as if i’m very detached from my own body, and am sometimes taken aback when i see myself in a mirror and am reminded i am in fact a genuine, human person. my downright depressingly pessimistic view on the universe and it’s inhabitants - that it’s all fake, in a way, and everything is very much temporary, having no long lasting impact - probably doesn’t help this feeling. it’s not a lack of awareness; i’m almost hyper-aware of everything (sometimes called creepily observant). i don’t know how to describe it, really. justa constant star of being “out of it”. i was just curious if anyone else feels the same way? let me know if you do and we can try and explain it to each other :)",Depression

"a bit of background about me: male, turned 25 last week. i just feel like i have nothing and no one to live for. i’ve been really struggling lately. the people i count on to come and talk to when i feel like shit just flat out don’t answer my texts, so i’ve stopped bothering texting them. the only girl i’ve ever been into shot me down and also never answers my messages either. so i stopped texting her as well. no one bothers checking on me so why should i reach out to them? my aunt died from brain cancer 3 years ago. and my older sister was killed by a drunk driver. i was seeing a therapist but stopped because i couldn’t afford it. they care more about money than the health of their clients. america summed up in one sentence i guess. i dropped out of engineering school in october after 6 years of college and multiple majors, 6 classes shy of graduating because i just didn’t wanna do it anymore. i was burned out and sick of busting my ass with nothing to show for it but exhaustion and stress. i may or may not go back. my student loans are due starting in june which i can’t afford. i have a car payment on top of it, paying for a car that i never wanted in the first place with money that i don’t have. i only bought it to shut my parents up about it, because my other one which i much prefer wouldn’t pass emissions for a completely bullshit reason but ran and drove perfectly all the same. i just absolutely uselessing hate being told what i can and can’t do with my own damn car that i pay for 100% myself. my car is my therapist and my favorite thing that i own. i’m working a dead end job with no room for promotion or growth, and coronavirus got me laid off indefinitely til the whole mess dies down. i cannot possibly be expected to pay for all that shit when they know damn well millions of people are losing their uselessing jobs. it’s been a month since quarantine and i can’t really even leave my house. can’t have a social life. just feel like i have no one to turn to and i’m drowning. every uselessing day and i’m just done. i left my house earlier this evening fully intending on making it a one way trip. i waited til my family had all gone to bed, then i got in my car and just took off. i drove 2 hours away, into the next state looking for a good spot to carry it out. i eventually found a cliff and pulled up and just sat there for a few minutes looking out over it, trying to find the balls to drive over the edge. i got out of my car and sat on the hood just staring into the distance and started crying, thinking to myself how the useless it came to this and how alone i felt. i was sitting there in the dark with tears streaming down my face when i heard a car pull up behind me and felt flashing blue lights. i knew it was a cop at this point but didn’t bother trying to hide myself. i just leaned on the hood of my car and continued crying to myself. he approached with a flashlight and noticed me. apparently he thought my car was abandoned at first. he was a young guy, probably about my age. he asked for my license and registration which i gave him. i’d said maybe two words to him at this point, and i think he picked up on the fact that i seemed a bit off. he asked me how i was doing and what i was doing so far from home at this time of night. it was like 1 am at this point. i just said that i needed to get out and clear my head at first, but eventually i admitted that i had driven up here to kill myself. i thought he was gonna freak out and cuff me and drag me kicking and screaming to a mental hospital, but he actually was remarkably calm. he asked why and what was going on in my life. he even came over and sat next to me on the hood of my car and listened. i had stopped crying but the tears came flooding back as it all came out, how i felt like i had no one. he didn’t interrupt and even put an arm around me. i eventually said i planned to drive my car off this cliff because i was so unhappy. he was silent for a few seconds and then told me he knew how it feels to want to die. apparently he came close to suicide a few times. a quote he said really stuck with me. it was “sometimes you can have everything and it still feels like nothing.” and it hit me that that was exactly how i felt. he gave me his personal number and said to call or text any time of day if i needed to talk. we sat there til about 2:30ish just talking. it was so nice to just vent to someone. eventually he said that he had to get going, but knowing what i just told him, we both knew he couldn’t leave me there alone for obvious reasons. he walked me back to my car and reminded me that he gave me his number. he walked back to the police cruiser and backed out, flashing his headlights at me to do the same. he followed me to the highway, turning off onto a side road and honking as he drove away while i got on the entrance ramp. i drove the 2 hours back home, not completely believing what had just happened and how he saved my life. i never even got his name or badge number. i got home close to 5 this morning and no one was up yet luckily. i snuck in and went to my room and slept for about 3 hours. i gave no indication to my family that i tried suicide the night before. no one knew that i went out last night. i still haven’t told them and i don’t plan to. they have no idea that i could’ve died. i called the officer’s number and left him a voicemail thanking him again. he texted me later in the day saying his offer was still valid any time. i have no idea if he had to fill out any paperwork and don’t really want to ask. everyone has at least one secret that they’ll take to their grave, and this is probably mine. it’s a long shot that he’ll read this but if he does, i don’t know what to say to him or how to thank him. his compassion saved my life. it’s crazy to think what would’ve happened if he had taken a different patrol route and hadn’t come along when he did. he deserves a promotion and to win the lottery. i owe him my life. cops get a bad rap for being arrogant, power hungry racists with itchy trigger fingers, but this particular officer represents what humanity should be like. we wouldn’t have people killing themselves if we simply stopped being assholes to each other. i don’t know if there’s a department medal for talking a suicidal person off the ledge, literally in my case, but he deserves it. i could probably call his department number and get his name and send him something in the mail. not a bad idea. godspeed officer. i’ll never forget this and how someone cared, and cared enough to actually do something about it.",Depression

"i need to rant. this person i met at uni, and now live with, uses suicide and mental health as a cute personal characteristic about themselves. about a week of knowing them they randomly told me they had a date set for their suicide- it was a couple days after their mum's birthday. this is what first started making me dislike them. recently, i have found out that their 'suicide attempt' was that they thought about taking pills. that is not a suicide attempt. you didn't try to kill yourself, you thought about it. they openly talk about how they're suicidal and 'tried' to kill themselves to my friend, who is such a lovely person and has tried to kill himself and then they constantly stare at his scars making him feel uncomfortable. he does not deserve this person bragging about their suicide. they say this shit to me too. they do not know what it is like to try to kill yourself. they did not have their dad yelling and asking why they took pills whilst sat on the floor crying. they did not have to watch their dad call their mum to come home from work straight away because her daughters took an overdose. they did not have to watch their brothers concern faces leave the room from their parents forcing them upstairs. they did not have to avoid eye contact with their parents in the hospital because their sad faces broke their heart. they did not sleep for an entire day because of the side effects of taking tablets. i did. and they think it is something to tell everyone they meet as if its a fun little fact. all they did was brag about it to their mates. useless off. the look of my parents face's when i tried to kill myself is etched into my memory. they did not experience that. they do not have to right to flaunt it around in my face as though it is not affecting anyone else around them who has actually attempted suicide. im sorry this is long and ive already posted but there are things i need to get off my chest",Depression
